	<p><a href="http://alldaybreakfast.org">All Day Breakfast</a> is a tiny book-and-bakeshop. During the winter, we write and publish books. During the summer, we sell fresh baked bread at the farmers market. Dried goods and provisions are available year-round. <a href="http://alldaybreakfast.org">You can buy everything in season online.</a> 
	<p>ADB's beginner sourdough starter kit contains dried starter and an instruction booklet, which is also available <a href="/allday/sourdough.html">to read online</a> and <a href="/allday/sourdough.pdf">as a PDF to download and print at home</a>.
