	<p><a href="http://alldaybreakfast.org">All Day Breakfast</a> is a tiny book-and-bakeshop. I am your baker and your teacher, Jess Driscoll. I'm a home baker, raised and taught in my mother's kitchen, but I'm also <a href="http://www.foodsafe.ca/index.html">Food Safe certified</a>. Each market, I'll have whole wheat sourdough loaves for sale, as well as sweet and savoury experiments. In addition to baked goods, All Day Breakfast sells stickers, buttons, and zines--the perfect something to read as you relax with toast and tea. For the curious, my sourdough starter zine is available as <a href="/allday/sourdough.pdf">a PDF for you to download and print at home</a>. You can find the booth on the first two Sundays of each month at the <a href="http://www.whiterockfarmersmarket.ca">White Rock Farmers Market</a>, but if you're not a local, you can <a href="http://alldaybreakfast.org">shop provisions online</a>.
