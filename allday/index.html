	<p><a href="http://alldaybreakfast.org">All Day Breakfast</a> is a tiny bakeshop. The current menu includes whole wheat sourdough loaves, as well a sweet or savoury experiment, which changes each week. ADB is at the <a href="http://www.whiterockfarmersmarket.ca">White Rock Farmers Market</a> on the first two Sundays of September and October, and always <a href="http://alldaybreakfast.org">online</a>. 
	<p>On non-market Sundays, a limited number of loaves and baked goods are available for pre-order and pickup in the parking lot across the street from the market. You can order by email (hey at alldaybreakfast dot org) or ask about pickup at the next market!
	<p>In addition to bread, ADB sells sea salt, made at home with water collected from Crescent Beach, and a sourdough starter kit, containing a portion of a 2-year-old starter, dried, for you to bake at home. The instructions are included as a booklet, and also available <a href="/allday/sourdough.html">to read online</a> and <a href="/allday/sourdough.pdf">as a PDF to download and print at home</a>.
