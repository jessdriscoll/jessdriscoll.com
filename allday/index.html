	<p><a href="http://alldaybreakfast.org">All Day Breakfast</a> is a tiny bakeshop. The current menu includes whole wheat sourdough loaves, as well a sweet or savoury experiment, which changes each week. In 2020, ADB is at the <a href="http://www.whiterockfarmersmarket.ca">White Rock Farmers Market</a> on the first two Sundays of each month and always <a href="http://alldaybreakfast.org">online</a>. 
	<p>On non-market Sundays, a limited number of loaves and baked goods are available for pre-order and pickup in the parking lot across the street from the market. You can order by email (hey at alldaybreakfast dot org) or ask about pickup at the next market!
	<p>In addition to bread, buy sea salt made at home with water collected from Crescent Beach and the sourdough starter kit, containing a portion of a 2-year-old, dried, for you to bake at home. The instructions are included as a zine, also available as <a href="/allday/sourdough.pdf">a PDF to download and print at home</a>.
