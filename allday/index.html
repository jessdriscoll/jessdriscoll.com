	<p><a href="http://alldaybreakfast.org">All Day Breakfast</a> is a tiny shop. During the summer, we sell fresh baked bread at the farmers market. During the winter, we write and publish books. <a href="http://alldaybreakfast.org">You can buy everything in season online.</a> To go with bread and books, ADB has local sea salt, made at home with water collected from Crescent Beach, and a traditional sourdough starter kit, containing dried starter. The instructions are included as a booklet, which is also available <a href="/allday/sourdough.html">to read online</a> and <a href="/allday/sourdough.pdf">as a PDF to download and print at home</a>.
