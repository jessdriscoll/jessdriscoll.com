	<p><a href="http://alldaybreakfast.org">All Day Breakfast</a> is a tiny book-and-bakeshop. I'm Jess Driscoll, a home baker, raised and taught in my mother's kitchen and <a href="http://www.foodsafe.ca/index.html">Food Safe certified</a>. At each market, I'll have whole wheat sourdough loaves for sale, as well as sweet and savoury experiments which change each week. For you adventurous bakers, I sell my sourdough starter, dried, for you to take home. The instructions are included as a zine, also available here as <a href="/allday/sourdough.pdf">a PDF for you to download and print at home</a>. Find starter, sea salt, bread and breakfast provisions at the <a href="http://www.whiterockfarmersmarket.ca">White Rock Farmers Market</a> on the first two Sundays of each month, as well as <a href="http://alldaybreakfast.org">online</a>.
	<p>On non-market Sundays, I'll have a limited number of loaves and baked goods available for pre-order and pickup in the parking lot across the street from the market. Contact me by email (hey at alldaybreakfast dot org) or ask me about pickup at the next market!
