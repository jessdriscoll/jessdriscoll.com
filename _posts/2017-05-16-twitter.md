I have been trying so hard, for 6 months now, to not look at Twitter. It hasn't been working. Even from this side of the border, the US govt has my brain so fucked up. I can't sleep. I'm eating crap. It's really hard to convince myself the future will be better. This isn't all the US election's fault. Brexit stole an entire continent from me before I even had a chance to use my British passport. And my chance to find a job and save for a house wasÂ gone before I graduated university. The thing I struggle most with in therapy is "should" statements. "I should be settled by 35." "I should have met someone by now." "I should know what the fuck I'm doing with my life before it's over." I can't stop these thoughts. I know they don't help. Even typing this now is making me cry. Life should be better. And I don't know what to do to make it so.
