It's just a cup of coffee. My regular drink at Starbucks is a tall blonde roast with room for soy. If I'm getting it to go, I bring my own mug--printed with yellow bananas on a pink background--but a cup of coffee is more than a cup of coffee when I have the time to sit down and enjoy it.

My new thing is leaving the house by noon. I don't have to because I don't work until 3:30. But if I don't, the days slip away so fast. During the colder months, it's harder to find places to go that don't cost money.

So this $2.26 cup of coffee buys me a place to be, a conversation with a stranger, a plan. Today, I'm working on a list of books I'd like to publish this year. It's small, but that's how all big change starts.
