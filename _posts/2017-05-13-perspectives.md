Emily Carr: New perspectives on a Canadian icon 

"Indian Art broadened my seeing, loosened the formal tightness I had learned in England schools. Its bigness and stark reality baffled my white man's understanding. I was as Canadian-born as the Indian but behind me were old world heredity and ancestry well as Canadian environment. The new west called me, but my old world heredity, the flavour of my upbringing, pulled me back. I have been schooled to see outsides only, not struggle to pierce… I learned a lot from the Indians, but who except Canada herself could help me comprehend her great woods and spaces?"

"Canadian art institutions, with our history and it's account of the nation at their core, have repeatedly demonstrated that they are more firmly rooted in a geographic paradigm then in the narrative, temporal development of the subjects at hand." JL

“What I am looking for I must work out for myself. It is between God and me. Laziness made me desire to look at the pictures of the others, to try and pick up short-cut recipes that others have used…instead of going straight to the thing itself.”
