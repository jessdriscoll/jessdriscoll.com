[WRITING DOWN THE BONES by Natalie Goldberg](http://nataliegoldberg.com/books/writing-down-the-bones/)

This book is my comfort food. When things get hard, I read it. When I feel like I suck, I read it. When I need a reminder that writing is more than just words on a page, I read it.

Maybe you need that reminder, too.
