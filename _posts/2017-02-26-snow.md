My plan for today was to clean up my pots on my patio and get my seeds into dirt. I have two long windowsills that face south and get a lot of sun. It's still cold outside, colder than usual, but I don't want to wait to get started on my garden. Then I woke up to snow this morning. Actual snow on the ground. I knew it was going to get cold enough for snow last night, but I didn't expect it to stick.

I shouldn't be surprised. We've been having such an odd winter. When Vancouver hosted the winter Olympics in 2010, we didn't have enough snow for the snowboarding events. So far this year, we've had more snow than I've ever seen in my life. Something has definitely changed. Even scarier is how much it's changed in the 35 years I've been alive.

So I'm spending the morning indoors, soaking beans to get them ready for the crockpot, tending to the pans of sea water slowing turning to salt in my oven, watching the last two games of the Canadian women's curling championship. I made pancakes for breakfast and ate them with peanut butter. I have a big mug of Earl Grey tea with cinnamon-infused soy. I might go for a walk to the beach later. But this is a good day, too.
