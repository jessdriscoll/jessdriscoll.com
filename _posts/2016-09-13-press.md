My dad is British, and my mother is Canadian, so in our house, they drank coffee in the morning and tea in the evening. I never much cared for coffee. Although I'm not at all a morning person, I've never needed anything more than a few moments lazing in bed to wake myself up. I made it through college without getting addicted to coffee. As with alcohol, I just never cared with the taste. Then I started making it myself. My parents have an automatic drip coffeemaker, and my mom prefers a dark roast. I favour a French press and something lighter. During the summer, cold brew--coffee and water, sleeping together overnight in my fridge, and ready in the morning. I like a bit of (almond) milk, but it doesn't need sugar at all. Shaken with ice, it makes me so happy. I don't need coffee in the morning, but I want it.
