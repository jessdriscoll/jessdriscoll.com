Real Ones, a Norwegian band, make the pilgrimage to Woodstock (technically, Saugerties) to play ["The Weight"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-98DcWcVQg) while sitting in front of Big Pink. (They also went to Longyearbyen, the northernmost town in the world, to play ["Here Comes the Sun."](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGeP-iVUhww))
