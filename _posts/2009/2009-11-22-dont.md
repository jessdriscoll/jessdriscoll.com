I don’t know how this blog has lasted this long without me gushing about The Band's cover of Marvin Gaye's "Don't Do It." It’s the first song in THE LAST WALTZ (film), but it’s not on THE LAST WALTZ (album), and it’s actually the last song they did; the last song The Band ever did, really, when you think about it. 

[This version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11Y987Uf1wY) is from the shows that became their live album, Rock of Ages, and it’s brilliant. (It’s the version on my iPod, and that’s always weird, finally seeing the visual to go with the audio you know so well.)

[THE LAST WALTZ version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-iW1-xgLEY) is shorter (and Robbie’s really regretting bronzing his guitar), but THE LAST WALTZ version might be my favourite performance because you get Rick at the beginning, wishing the Americans a happy Thanksgiving, and Robbie at the end, wishing everyone a goodnight, goodbye.
