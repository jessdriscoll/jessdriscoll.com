[Camera One By Josh Joplin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TipSO1Pta3M)

I have an oddly sharp memory when it comes to music. This song is leaning into the ancient radio at my night shift factory job because the voice caught my ear. Until I got home to Google some lyrics, I was convinced it was the new R.E.M. single. It still confuses me sometimes, even without my orange foam earplugs.
