[Edward Sharpe & The Magnetic Zeros - Home (live @ kcrw)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRA5S59KjwY)

I discovered this song a couple of days ago, and I haven't really stopped thinking about it since. I'm Canadian, OK? I know my sprawling, collaborative, multi-instrumentalist, multi-vocalist, indie bands, but these guys managed to surprise me. It only struck me now that the wild abandon with which they perform this song makes it a perfect post for a happy Christmas.

>home / let me come home / home is wherever I'm with you
