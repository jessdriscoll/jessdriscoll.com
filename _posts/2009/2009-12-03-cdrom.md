[Foo Fighters - TINLTL Documentary [1999]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvBKEXfwKqE)

This is the doc wherein Dave does his impression of Drunk Dave, Who Was In Nirvana, The Greatest Rock Band Of The Nineties. There Is Nothing Left To Lose is one of the first CDs I remember to come with bonus CD-ROM extras. Remember when CD-ROM was the publishing media of the future? And now we're watching this on YouTube.
