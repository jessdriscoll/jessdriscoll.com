I started an entry last night about ROBIN HOOD, but, I don't know, I keep forgetting how to post. Here's something I never do: a meme, word association from Megan.

1. Jamie Oliver

Oh, I love Jamie Oliver a lot. He's adorable and British, he loves his family, he makes my favourite kind of food. His "Jamie at Home" is better than all the "(blank) at Home" shows it spawned. It's better than anything else on the Food Network, actually. He chose to do battle against Mario Batali on IRON CHEF AMERICA, one of only two chefs worth battling. He's linguistically interesting. He needs to stop calling food "brave," but I covet his outdoor ovens anyway.

2. communal music

I'm not sure how to define this exactly. I can't live without music, and I get that from my parents. We have a 25 disc changer in our living room, which gets swapped out every few months. I'm usually the one to do it because I get tired of the selection the fastest, and, well, I bought most of the CDs we own. So the communal music in our house is a lot of mine, but I grew up with parents with great taste in music, so it all works out in the end, I think. Everything I love can be traced back to something in my childhood, something in my parents's record collection. For all the rest of the time, I have an iPod, and I don't have to listen to the communal music of public transit. 

We share the music of our cities, countries, in venues, and on the radio, but I still think of my music as mine.

3. Prince Edward Island

I've seen a lot of this country of mine, but I've never seen PEI. I've seen everything between here and Montreal, but not the North and not the Maritimes. I think I could live there. I've only read ANNE OF GREEN GABLES once, though, and that was a long time ago. My province is an acronym, too. The whole of PEI is smaller than the city where I live right now. It seems like a good place to live on your bicycle and on foot. I didn't know the Prince Edward was Queen Victoria's father.

4. buses

My favourite thing about public transit (and here in Vancouver the Skytrain is just as important as the bus) is that I get to watch the world around me rather than just the stretch of road straight in front of me. I do all my best thinking and writing on the bus. Buses can be great cultural meetingplaces. They usually aren't, but it's the humanist dream.

5. Jon Walker

When I was just falling in love with Panic! at the Disco, Shana asked if I had a favourite, I said, "I don't think I do? Maybe Jon." This was after doing a little reading and looking at some photos. When I started watching interviews and behind the scenes stuff, I tipped towards Spencer and his thinly-veiled contempt (for anything, really, that isn't making music). I can't really explain Jon Walker. He's a simple guy, whose spelling and grammar make me cringe, but that doesn't mean I don't think he's hot. 

I've been working on this entry for four hours now, and in a weird way, it's made me realise that I like archetypes and patterns more than the thing itself because as nice as Jon Walker is to look at, I'll still be more fascinated by his role in the band and how it changed their music.
