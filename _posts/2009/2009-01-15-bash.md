I'm in love with Google Docs. I've been living online since 2002, yet gdocs has managed to shift my writing paradigm completely. There's always something open in a tab, something I'm poking at. It feeds my short attention span, but in this weird way where I'm actually productive. It's a bit of a job right now, moving every great idea I've ever had out of the box of notebooks and into the relevant gdoc. But it's gonna be great when I can open one file, see all my work, and bash at it until it's done. That's what I'm working towards.

2009 is the year of the bash. I'm calling it. The goal is a zine a month, and there are already 10 gdocs on their way to becoming January through October.
