+ saw a late screening of OBJECTIFIED with my dad  
+ Ronan and Erwan Bouroullec were adorable  
+ being a designer means looking at the world and always asking, why is it like this? why isn't it like this instead? I like that.  
+ that cabinet with "everything was beautiful and nothing hurt" carved, each word, into the drawers. Amazing.
