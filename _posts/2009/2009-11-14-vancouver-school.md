Mimic by Jeff Wall (1982) is one of two photographs on [the Wikipedia page for the Vancouver School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vancouver_School). It's defined there as post-conceptual photography. It's so comforting knowing I don't have to go very far at all to explain what I'm doing with photography.
