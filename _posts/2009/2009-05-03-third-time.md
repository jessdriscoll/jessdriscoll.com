Third time lucky. Finally got to see The Weakerthans, with Oh Susanna and Constantines, live last night, but it was Constantines who made my night. They're one of those bands who I like when I hear them, but I haven't gone looking. I went looking as soon as I got home. They rarely stood still long enough to get a good, clear photo. Up on their toes, then bent over completely in half, strings nearly snapping the way they attack their guitars. Frantic. They even packed up their own stuff when they were done. I love that.

That's not to say The Weakerthans weren't worth the wait. Every song was the one I wanted to hear, and with four albums, that isn't easy. There were horns. I don't complain when my bands come with horns.
