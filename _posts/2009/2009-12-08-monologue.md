[Seinfeld 084 / Pinky Toe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feLb55orOHk)

Michael Richards delivers a monologue to replace a scene they had planned to film, but didn't have the time, the money, whatever. Doesn't matter, because what SEINFELD did better than anything else was prove that sometimes the better choice is tell, not show.
