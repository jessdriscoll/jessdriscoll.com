It seems like it should be superficial to care this much about how a TV show looks, but it's not. My favourite things on actual TV right now are WHITE COLLAR (old world fashion and New York City) and GOSSIP GIRL (new world fashion and New York City). You have to build a seamless world for your characters to live in, and it doesn't have to be real for me--it has to be real for them. I love the crap out of MIAMI VICE's worldbuilding and have a maybe unhealthy obsession with telephones from the 1980s. After a quick reminder that there are also kickass chicks on this show--that would be Gina in the sequins, Trudy in the polka dots. It's not all about Crockett and Tubbs; it's about their world. (Definitely Miami, by the way, is the name of the episode starring Ted Nugent. Feel free to play along with the game I'm calling Spot the Rock Star.)
