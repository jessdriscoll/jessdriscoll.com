Ezra Pound's daughter doesn't have her own Wikipedia page. Instead, it redirects to her husband, Boris. Information may be open source, but women are still the property of their husbands.

UPDATE 2019-05-30: Today, [Mary de Rachewiltz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_de_Rachewiltz) has her own page.
