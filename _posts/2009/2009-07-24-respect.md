Mark Cavendish has started the Tour three times, but never finished. He's never made it this far before, and I think you can see the difference in [this interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ftw6Ndh4cU8), after his most recent stage win, his fifth this Tour. The arrogance that makes him good television is gone, left behind in the mountains maybe, replaced by an even deeper respect for what his team does to get him to the finish line. Wild, but humble still manages to be good TV.
