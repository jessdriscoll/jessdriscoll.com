How meta would it be to open a bricks-and-mortar shop where you sell ideas? Shelves, but nothing on display.

I talk a lot about getting people to pay us for naming things. I'll find a name for anything from your pet to your blog to your new shade of green. It's a pretty amorphous talent, hard to pin down, then I was rolling this idea around in my head, and I suppose it's actually what ad agencies do. But instead of men in suits with easels in boardrooms, I want to stick a neon price tag on thoughts, put concepts in brown paper packages, and send clients home with the final draft a reusable canvas bag.
