This is a screen cap from MIAMI VICE: 201 Prodigal Son. This is the same scene, a Crockett-lost-in-New-York-and-his-own-head montage set to "You Belong to the City" by Glenn Frey. This is the Wikipedia page for "You Belong to the City" by Glenn Frey, which explains that the song was written especially for MIAMI VICE. (Frey guest-starred in a season 1 episode.) This is the music video, wherein clips from MIAMI VICE: 201 Prodigal Son are interspersed with a Frey-lost-in-New-York-and-his-own-head montage set to "You Belong to the City" by Glenn Frey, of course.
