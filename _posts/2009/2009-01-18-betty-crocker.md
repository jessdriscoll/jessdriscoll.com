The only resolution I'm making this year is this: finish. There's nothing wrong with a work in progress, but, eventually, it needs to stop being in progress and just be a work. Of course, I'm starting with the little things first, the things almost done. It's a nice rush of accomplishment to carry you into the big things next. 

Today, watching ADAM'S RIB, I finished scanning this set of 1975 Betty Crocker recipe cards I found in the basement. There are certainly more horrific recipes to showcase--stews made with weiners and boeuf en gel√©e--but my mom actually made this apple tree cake. She always made us a cake for our birthdays. I remembered this wasn't mine--my youngest brother, I'm sure--but couldn't recall which year. I asked her, just now, and she thinks maybe it was for his second birthday because, "Everyone got a teddy bear for their first."
