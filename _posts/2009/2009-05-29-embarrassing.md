1. I've been on Twitter since '06, and I don't know why I resist talking about fandom stuff because, really, I tell my dad, so why shouldn't I tell the world that I can't stop watching STAR TREK because of Bones or that I've been watching an embarrassing amount of MIAMI VICE or that I can't believe we still don't have an airdate for the new season of TORCHWOOD (July, but when?!). There's not much left when you admit your crush on Tom Selleck.

2. I'm just so much more likely to post to Twitter these days.
