I'm watching the AMERICAN EXPERIENCE doc about the assassination of Abraham Lincoln, and his funeral train reminded me of the photos taken from Robert Kennedy's funeral train. 103 years later, and it's the same damn America. When I'm a cynic, I think they do everything they can to make themselves iconic, but things like this, they just happen.
