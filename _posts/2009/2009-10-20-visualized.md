[Here Come The Waves: The Hazards of Love Visualized Trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0jFoNddj0s)

At Royce Hall at UCLA, The Decemberists played the entirety of THE HAZARDS OF LOVE. But they also had Becky Stark and Shara Worden there to do their vocals. But they also had four animators create a series of films to go with it. But they also took a little break, then came back to play a ton of really old songs. But they also brought the girls back to kill Heart's "Crazy on You." But they also turned us into a chorus, invited us onstage for a dance party, and made us sing a song for tying shoes. I feel pretty good about saying that was the best rock show I've ever seen.
