Please understand that when I say I want to write a half hour television show about Benjamin Franklin's printshop, his apprentices underfoot, his book club, his friends in power and enemies, too, his occasional political service, and his more frequent scathing editorials written under pseudonyms, it's not about dragging Franklin down to the level of a sitcom.

It is about raising the level of a sitcom to Franklin.
