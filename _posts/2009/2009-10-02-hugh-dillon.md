[Hugh Dillon on Q TV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTiMixXmGUo) 

A timely interview. Not only did I just finish marathoning FLASHPOINT (because of Hugh Dillon), but tonight I'm heading out to see Michael Turner read. He's the guy who wrote HARD CORE LOGO and Dillon's breakout role, Joe Dick. Dillon goes on to namecheck Callum Keith Rennie for making him love acting, and there's a nice riff on the Billy Bob Thornton thing, because Hugh Dillon also has a new record coming out. Sounds crazy, Billy, but you can do different things at the same time, and it's all about expression.
