>While we were passing through the crowded bazaars this after-noon, I was very much interested and amused by the number and variety of the street calls or cries. Two lads, carrying between them a large tray loaded of bread, cried out, "Ya Karim! ya Karim!"¬ù That is not the name for bread. No, it is one of the attributes of God, and signifies the bountiful or generous; and since bread is the staff of life, the name implies that it is the gift of the Bountiful One.
