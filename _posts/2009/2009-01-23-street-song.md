[Alabama's beginning and end speech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nuoXEkDlWr8) feature a piece of music you may have heard first in BADLANDS, echoed in TRUE ROMANCE, called Gassenhauer ("street song"¬ù), written by Carl Orff in the 20th C, inspired by Hans Neusiedler from the 16th. Goddamn I love artists.
