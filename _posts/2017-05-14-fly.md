I've had a fly in my house for three days. I don't know how it got in. All of my windows have screens, and my door is only open when I leave the house or when I come home. So today, I left the door open for a few hours hoping to convince the fly to leave. It was a nice day--blue sky and sun--but when it started getting cold, I had to close the door. The fly had not left; it was in my shower. There's a tiny window in there, but it's frosted, and it wasn't open.

There's freedom through the open door, little fly. Go. Be wild. There's nothing in here for you.
