Yesterday I lamented that I probably wasn't going to make a deadline today. But I did! I talked about how in [this morning's video] (https://youtu.be/X15hy1mWcvo). I wrote 2800 words today and submitted the story to an anthology.

But I didn't actually write all of it; I dictated it. (And then I did a ton of typing and editing after, but the dictation is the new part.) I do a lot with Siri on my phone, mostly using the voice recognition for short messages in Slack or texts or just notes when I'm walking and I can't write something down. But this was the very first time I had dictated something longer than a blog post.

I'm so happy with how it turned out. I can't believe how easy it was and why I didn't try this earlier.  This morning, I wasn't sure I'd finish the story, and I felt bad about giving up. So I sat down and did it, any way possible. I'm so proud of myself for doing it. I knew that I could write it, and I figured out a way.

I'm going to write a lot more like this. The more I talk, the more I write, the more I shoot, the more ideas I can get out of my head and into the world.
