I want to be better at blogging. I'm great at writing in my notebook. I carry it (and my pencil case) wherever I go. I even started doing Morning Pages again two weeks ago. I borrowed The Artist's Way from the library and decided to do the thing for real this time. Today is the first day of Week 3.

It's perfect timing, really. I'm never happier than when I have a project, and my yoga teacher training course is nearly done. There's a lot of work left to do: a four-class series, anatomy final exam, holistic class evaluation, short essay, as well as the required first aid course to come after. But by this time next month, I'll be done. I started in September, and I can't believe it went so fast.

On to the next project. The Artist's Way might seem a little flighty from the outside, but as someone who has had a fairly regular writing practice for more than 15 years, I know what you can learn by paying attention. It's only week three, but things are happening already, and the only explanation that makes sense is that the universe is paying attention, too.
