Yesterday, I got up early, in the rain, to get a flu shot. And then I walked to the mall, in the rain, to pick up my new medication. And then I taught three classes, and thankfully, the rain had stopped by the time I walked home, in the dark.

So when I finally made it into bed last night, I crashed hard. I guess I needed that more than I needed to write a blog post last night.
