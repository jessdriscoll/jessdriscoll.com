When I’m out of milk, life is just a little bit more difficult. Coffee without milk is undrinkable to me. Tea, I like, but not the same. 

I got out of bed this morning, knowing I had finished the milk yesterday, and I didn’t know what to do first. My morning routine starts with making coffee. My morning routine was interrupted. 

More than routine, milk is childhood comfort. We drank it with every meal. We bought it by the jug. Even though I drink soy now, it serves the same familiar purpose. I know what I can make when I have milk in the fridge. 

My 7-year-old friend across the street says she can’t sleep until she drinks warm milk. I don’t want to sleep until I have a cup of tea. My bedtime routine was interrupted.
