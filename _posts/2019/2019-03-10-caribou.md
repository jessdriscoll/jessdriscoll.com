My whole life there’s been a caribou on the quarter. My whole life there have been nine reindeer pulling Santa’s sleigh. This week I learned those two things are the same species: Rangifer tarandus. 

To be honest, it’s blowing my mind a little. How did I miss this? Two important symbols I encounter almost daily. I suppose I assumed they were the same family, cousins maybe. But science says, same species, regional names. 

Today, I listened to Paul Simon’s GRACELAND for the first time in a long time. And yet, I can sing every word of every song. 

Sometimes my brain seems so full of trivia, and I wonder what might have been if I wasn’t like this. But then I learn a brand new fact, and I remember there’s still so much more room. The brain is never full and finished, not until the end.
