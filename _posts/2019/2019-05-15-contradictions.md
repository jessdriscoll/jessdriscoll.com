I hate that I’m not getting paid today; I love getting a day off. I want to go back to bed; I know I should get out of the house. I want to write; I want to hike. I shouldn’t spend any money; I don’t want to cook. The weather is nice; the weather never lasts. I need my laptop; I need my notebook. I want to be alone; I want to hang out. I will make something today; I will never make anything ever again.
