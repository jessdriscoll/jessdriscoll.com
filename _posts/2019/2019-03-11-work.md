Working three days a week is not ideal, but I enjoy it. If I had the choice, I wouldn’t work at all. Currently, I always have Wednesday off and sometimes have Monday off. The latter was true today. 

But! I feel like I used my time well today. I did some big cleaning, like vacuuming the main room and washing the cushion covers and bed linen. I roasted a whole bag of sweet potatoes for meals this week. I created some new Etsy listings, and I uploaded some blog posts from 2010. (I also set a goal to complete my archives back to 2002 by the end of the year.)

I had a walk on my list, but the rain started some time this afternoon. So I read my book and worked on a story. Last week, I made a promise to post it tomorrow, and that’s what I’m going to do. It might not be any good, but I’m gonna meet my deadline.
