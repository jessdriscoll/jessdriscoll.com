I’m having trouble finishing things lately. This is not unusual. Rather, it’s a very good indicator as to whether my medication is working. 

The best thing I’ve recovered in the last year is my ability to read. I’ve missed books more than I knew. But for the last month or so, I haven’t been able to settle in. I put CAT’S EYE on hold because it was too upsetting (like Joey putting LITTLE WOMEN in the freezer when Beth gets sick). The Bible has been on my coffee table for months without being opened. 

I’m trying to read GATSBY’S GIRL, a historical fiction about F. Scott Fitzgerald’s first love. I also have two of his novels, one short story collection, a speculative novel about Zelda, and a book of their letters. That could be a reading project to take me through the summer.

This morning, I watched YOU ARE HERE, a documentary about the airline passengers who were stranded in Gander, Newfoundland, on 9/11–the inspiration for the musical, COME FROM AWAY. So now I’m reading William Langewiesche’s AMERICAN GROUND. 

I’ve been collecting books for my entire life. Of course I have something for every occasion, every project, every moment of serendipity. And the pile on my coffee table grows taller.
