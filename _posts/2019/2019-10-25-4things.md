1. A few years, I started a habit of posting Four Things That Are Working For Me This Week. Today is Friday, which is as good a reason as any to restart a habit. 

2. I’m writing from Dos Hermanos, the nearest Mexican restaurant, usually my first eating stop on any US trip. Their tortillas are homemade and a yellow colour like no other. 

3. Thursday at my local grocery store is pizza night, when their take-and-bakes are only $9. I bought one last night for Thursday dinner, Friday bus lunch, and Saturday lunch while tabling. Good deal. 

4. While in Olympia, I’m staying at the Doubletree Hilton. Their bit is a warm chocolate chip cookie when you check in. It’s even on their comment card: Were you given a cookie? Yes, I was.
