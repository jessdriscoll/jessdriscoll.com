[Sarah McNeil](https://www.etsy.com/ca/shop/SarahMcNeil) prints her zines on a risograph machine, which looks cooler than a photocopy, but isn’t as expensive as a letterpress. Pups is a minizine printed in blue and burgandy. Illustrations of dogs (shiba inu?) are combined with a few lines of poetry. Simple. Lovely.

The surprise happens when you unfold this zine completely. An 8-page minizine is one piece of paper, printed on one side, then folded. But Sarah has printed both sides, and a flock of dog heads greet you on the reverse. 

This zine is from 2014, and I don’t see it in her shop anymore. But she still draws dogs and prints on a risograph. If you buy one of her mystery packages, perhaps you might find Pups.
