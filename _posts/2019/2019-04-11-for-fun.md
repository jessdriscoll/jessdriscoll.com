The other day, I started writing this short thing. It was just an idea, then I figured out how to do it, and then I started writing in Notes on my phone. I always write faster on my laptop, simply because I type faster than I tap. But I write more on my phone because it’s always nearby.

So I’ve been working on this thing, just a little piece of fiction for fun, and it’s good. It was good. Until that voice in my brain started telling me it wasn’t.

I know I shouldn’t listen. I know I should shout it down. But it’s loud, and I’m tired, and how do I know that I’m right and the voice is wrong? How can I say I’m good when I only have rejections to show for my effort? 

How can I write for fun when it isn’t fun anymore?
