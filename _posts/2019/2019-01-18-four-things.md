Four Things Working For Me This Week

1. Pasta. More specifically, spaghettini, which was on sale for $1 a package. At the end of the day, pasta is the easiest thing in the world to make for dinner. 
2. Sourdough starter. I’ve turned it into waffles, pizza, and plain old bread. The responsibility of keeping sourdough starter alive is also kinda like having a plant or a pet. 
3. Getting a ride home on Tuesdays and Fridays with my student who lives across the street. 
4. Library holds. I put my order in online, then pick up all the books at once. It’s like having a personal shopper. (It also prevents the very real danger of browsing the stacks and coming home with far too many books.) This month, I’m reading about Walt Whitman.
