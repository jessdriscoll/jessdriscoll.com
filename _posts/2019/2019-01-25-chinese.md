One of my students lives across the street from me, and on Tuesdays and Fridays, her grandma gives me a ride home. Tonight, they invited me out to dinner with them. 

We ate at the new Chinese restaurant that opened before Christmas. The two girls (4 and 7) laughed at my pronunciation as they tried to teach me Chinese words. We marvelled at the king crab in the tanks. 

Thatâ€™s my kind of Friday night.
