As I’ve spent the last week reorganising my shelves, I’ve realised how much I’m looking forward to having fewer books. This is a complete reversal for me. If you had asked me as a teenager what I wanted in the future, at least one of my answers would be “a library.”

But when I was a teenager, there was no such thing as Wikipedia or Project Gutenberg. Today, if I need to find a reference, I don’t need a book. 

I need books, of course. But I don’t need every book. 

I want to keep the best, my favourites, the ones I know I’ll read again. At the moment, that’s two full bookshelves. Nine more to read and decide what else gets to stay.
