You Must Always Have A Secret Plan is a minizine, but printed on both sides. On the outside, it’s a traditional book, with tiny pages. But when you unfold the paper, inside is a full-size poster. 

I have [Issue #6](https://www.etsy.com/ca/listing/400855133/you-must-always-have-a-secret-plan-issue?ref=shop_home_active_14), but it’s a continuing series, with so much more to explore. I love how the artist, Amy Madden, uses the whole piece of paper. There are backgrounds and tiny details, and the drawings don’t stay on their page. They cross the gutters and spill all over the paper.

A minizine might not seem like much. When folded up, a minizine is 2.75 x 4.25 inches small. But there is a whole world to explore in here. You might even find the secret plan.
