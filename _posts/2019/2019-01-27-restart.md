I was all ready today to write a blog post about how my MacBook Air has finally died. Last night, it was doing some funny things, so I restarted it. But then it couldn’t get past the login screen. 

After doing all the tricks I know, I called support. She walked me through the same tricks, but this time, it worked!

Perhaps it’s the order of operations, not the grasping for something that might work, which brought my laptop back to life. No matter the reason, I’m grateful. 

I spent the rest of the night backing up everything, just in case.
