[Zine Machine](https://zine-machine.glitch.me) was created by [Rowan Merewood](https://glitch.com/@rowan-m) It’s a web app for making zines. But it’s also a zine, too. It’s a combination of words and images. It teaches something that somebody loves. You can read it in the browser. You can print it, fold it, cut it, and turn it into a minizine to read. 

(Warning: it prints differently from different browsers. I found Chrome worked best for me.)

The platform where this zine lives, Glitch, isn’t just for hosting web apps, but for remixing them, too. You can use the code for this app and create your own digital zine with print functionality. In this way, Glitch feels a lot like a zine, too—a new incarnation with the same old spirit.
