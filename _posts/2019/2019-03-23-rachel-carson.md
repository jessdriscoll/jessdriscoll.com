1. My library’s current book sale is the leftovers from weeding out the biography section. My Art Space table is directly next to the book sale shelves, and I couldn’t resist picking up William Souder’s bio of Rachel Carson, ON A FARTHER SHORE. 

2. I only learned Carson was queer when I watched a recent documentary. Her relationship with Dorothy Freeman is fascinating, and I desperately want to read their collected letters now. 

3. I’ve actually read none of Carson’s books. I didn’t even know she was a bestseller before SILENT SPRING. 

4. [You can still read the pamphlets she wrote as a U.S. Fish and Wildlife employee!](http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/do/search/?q=author_lname%3A%22Carson%22%20author_fname%3A%22Rachel%22&start=0&context=52045&facet=)

5. Farley Mowat wrote a review of THE ENDURING SEA, her third ocean book, and he said she had overdone it, which is rich coming from a man who wrote a million books about boys lost in the woods. 

6. >A few months after the Trinity test, the Eastman Kodak Company in Rochester, New York, started seeing blips and streaks on unexposed film it manufactured for industrial X-ray equipment. After some investigation, Kodak determined that the film was being contaminated by radiation emanating from the cardboard containers into which it was packaged. The cardboard had come from a couple of different suppliers in Iowa and Indiana—paper mills that drew their water from rivers flowing out of midwestern watersheds that were downwind of the Trinity test, albeit many hundreds of miles downwind.

7. I would love to see that film on a wall in a gallery. 

8. This bio was published in 2012 for the 50th anniversary of the publication of SILENT SPRING. We’re now seven years past that, and the Earth is so much worse off. 

9. Rachel Carson was dying as she wrote that book. Two years later, she would be gone. 

10. Carbon 14, a radionuclide, one of many leftovers from nuclear testing, has a half-life of 8,000 years.
