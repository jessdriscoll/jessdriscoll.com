My favourite thing about zine shows isn’t selling my work; it’s trading mine for the chance to collect other people’s. The first zine I traded at Euzine was by [Jack McDonald](https://www.instagram.com/alison_and_hobbes/). Small scenes from a single night play out over a few words and a lot of white space. One moment in time, captured and recorded—not only for those who were there to remember, but for all of us to share.

Most of us who make zines don’t have a lot of money. We don’t do this because we imagine we’ll get rich (though paying a couple of the bills would be nice). It’s why my zines are inexpensive. Most of them, you can download for free and print yourself. I love the artifact of paper, but the words are most important. I want you to read what I write.

Even if you don’t have a table, bring your zines to a zine show. After Jack and I traded zines, I wrote a sign for my table to let others know they could ask. Before I did zine shows, I did craft fairs. The other artists are always the best customers; we appreciate the work in a different way. We support each other because support lifts us all.
