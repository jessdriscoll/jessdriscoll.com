Very early on Friday morning, I finished the first draft of my novel. I keep stopping myself from qualifying this statement: it’s ONLY a children’s book, it’s ONLY 12,000 words, it’s ONLY a first draft with a lot more work to do. 

But I stop before I say that because, though it’s all true, it’s not ONLY anything. It’s an accomplishment to finish anything, no matter how small. It’s hard to keep going when you’re not sure what it’ll be. It’s the first long piece of fiction I’ve written in years. 

I’m celebrating this first draft. I’m excited for the second.
