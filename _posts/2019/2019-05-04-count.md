I used to write everything on my Mac in an app called nvALT. The ALT is for “alternative” because it was a fork of an app called Notational Velocity (NV). I’m sure there were many features in nvALT, but the one that mattered to me, the reason NV wasn’t good enough, was the on-screen word count.

I stopped using nvALT when long notes started hanging. Not sure how much was the app or how much was my 2011 Air, but by that time, Apple Notes had a new design I actually liked. Notes also had an iOS version, while nvALT still doesn’t. 

The two apps work exactly the same way, so it wasn’t a problem for me to switch. Except for one feature—that one feature that mattered to me.
