Friday mornings, there’s a life drawing session at the community centre. I haven’t been in a few months now, but I’m thinking about going tomorrow. A few months ago, waking up in time to be ready to leave to catch a bus uphill to be there for 10am was a really hard thing for me. Now, I’m out of bed before 8 every morning, and most days, it’s much earlier than that. Logistically, I could go. 

But another reason I haven’t been going is I don’t know what to do with my drawings. Yes, practice is good. Yes, it’s important to be out among people. Yes, I enjoy drawing. But then I put them in a box. 

And all my boxes are already full.
