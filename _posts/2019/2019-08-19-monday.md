- Called Dr. M to change appointment to a phone call
- Because I worked in Langley at 10
- Finished all the leftover Sunday crosswords, plus the Mondays
- Tried to pick up my new prescription 
- But I had to go home first to pick up and return my old prescription 
- Bought milk and Lays limited edition flavours
