Today was the last zine workshop because it’s also the last day of spring break. Tomorrow, my students are back, and I’m working four days again. 

When I proposed this zine workshop to the library, I thought teenagers might be interested. I was hoping some adults would come out. But the people most interested in making tiny books are young girls, the same age I was when I first started. 

Two girls—sisters—came every single Sunday. One of their friends came to the last three. We always managed to convince a few more girls to join us, once they got a look at what we were making. 

The boys looked, but they wouldn’t sit down. But the girls, they wanted to make something.
