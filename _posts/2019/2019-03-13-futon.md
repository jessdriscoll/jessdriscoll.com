This is my first night on the hard futon in my parents’s guest room. I’ll be here, taking care of three cats, while my parents are in Japan for spring break. I’ll be here until the end of the month. 

This futon is not comfortable. My feet hang off the edge. And I can never seem to get through a visit without one of the cats peeing on my bed. (I don’t know why! They barely come in this room! How can they be mad?)

But this futon is great. It’s the best incentive to get out of bed early and effective motivation to keep me from crawling back in for an afternoon nap.
