Two years ago, the Lower Mainland had the coldest, snowiest winter in my memory. That was the same winter I was doing my yoga teacher training, commuting early mornings downtown and wearing fleece-lined leggings. From November to March, I wore the MEC my parents sent me when I lived in Halifax. 

I haven’t worn it since. The first time I thought I might need those fleece-lined leggings in November, I literally sweat my ass off. Now they’re in the bottom drawer with my shorts and swimsuits, unused. 

This winter hasn’t been warm, but it hasn’t been cold enough or wet enough for snow. Not until this weekend. 

I didn’t believe it when they told me it was coming. But it came on Sunday. The snow is mostly melted now, but wow, it’s cold. It’s hard to get out of the house, even harder to get out of bed when it’s so cold.
