I rode the wave of New Year energy and new meds to clean and organize my entire apartment in January. I feel SO accomplished and also calmer in my new space, so that was a success. 

But where January was about working on the external, February is shaping up to be a month to work on the internal. I’ve been trying to muscle my way through some personal creative projects, and it’s just not working like it has before. I can’t make myself start. 

But instead of feeling the guilt and shame I always do, I’m recognising it this time around as a sign to step back and let go. Those projects will get done eventually, but it doesn’t have to be right now. I’m recognising I need a lot LESS in my life, but it’s hard to accept that also means less of my art. 

So February is gonna be a quiet one for me, and that’s gonna be OK.
