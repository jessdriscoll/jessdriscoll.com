I’m so lucky to live a short walk from the beach. But last winter, during a particularly harsh storm, the White Rock pier was destroyed. The beach has been fenced off ever since. 

Some small sections are opening up now, but I’m not ready for the crowds on a sunny Sunday. 

I’m so lucky to live a short bus ride from another beach across town. The advantage of a peninsula is a scrap of coastline can always be found. I sat on the beach and watched the kids and the dogs play in the water like it’s already summer. It was busy today, but not crowded or noisy. 

Rain, then sun—the perfect west coast weekend.
