Not a good sign that I’m reading about ADHD at 11 o’clock at night. When I started seeing my GP last year, she suggested—on top of the diagnosed depression and anxiety—I might also have OCD. I had never considered it before, but it made a lot of sense. 

I had considered—and rejected—ADHD, but now I’m thinking I need to go right back to the beginning and start all over. [This BuzzFeed article](https://www.buzzfeed.com/kellyoakes/these-adults-have-adhd-but-were-misdiagnosed-for-decades) has me wondering what else has been missed. 

I knew I had depression before a doctor told me I did, but (because I have depression) I didn’t trust my instincts. I was lucky to grow up with the internet. It meant I read a lot of stories about other people’s lives. I recognised myself in their stories of depression. 

I didn’t recognise myself in every symptom of ADHD, but I certainly have some: inability to focus, loud inner thoughts, lack of motivation. But these are depression symptoms, too. And anxiety symptoms. 

The Venn diagram of mental illness is difficult to read.
