With the moderate success of my zine workshops in March, the librarian agreed to let me rebrand Art Space as Pen & Paper Club. The hope is that a clearer focus will get more people to come out. 

I’m gonna blame the rain for the lack of turnout tonight. Because if I can’t blame the rain, it means people just don’t care.
