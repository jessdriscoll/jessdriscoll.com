- another early work day out to Langley
- oh, wait, I’m not on the schedule??
- this time, it’s not my fault
- but I taught two classes anyway
- compensation for my trouble
- I came all the way home
- and did not go out for lunch
- and I would like some credit for that
- but then I spent the rest of the day in some kind of awful spinning brain cloud
- I really hate what Twitter has done to my head.
