For about a week now, the weather has been amazing: sunny, blue skies, not too cold. A little bit of rain. This is good spring break weather. 

Yet I don’t trust it. We’re still in March, even though we’ve passed the equinox. But more pointedly, the weather of the last five years has been so wild, so unprecedented, so changeable, I’ve lost my instincts. 

The southwest coast of Canada is famous for rain. Many people choose this part of the country because we get very little snow. The Lower Mainland used to be textbook temperate. Some days, all of those things are still true. 

But those days no longer arrive in the same order. Today was sunny, but chilly. The rain lasted five minutes. Tomorrow? Who knows.
