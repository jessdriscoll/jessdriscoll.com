In May, my doctor ran the full course of tests. I was worried about diabetes, which runs in my family, but instead, we discovered I’m anemic. 

Eight months of iron supplements and leafy greens later, I had blood drawn again today. It’s a pretty painless process for me, for which I’m grateful. I used to hate getting shots, swallowing pills, sitting through that optical air test. 

When I think back on my resistance, I recognise it as my refusal to do life like everyone else. I’m neither a leader nor a follower. I just want to do my own thing. 

But not at the expense of my health. So I swallow my pills and I get my shots. Adulthood doesn’t have to get in the way of life.
