In a lot of ways, it was a pretty good Monday. I made an excellent pot of coffee this morning. I went for a walk and just missed the rain. I did my least favourite chores. I worked at the Langley office, and I had a chance to talk to my boss about my hours. Now I’m going to bed, and I’m leaving my phone in the living room.

By all the measures which matter right now, that’s a good day for me. But I’m just gonna have to do it over again tomorrow. And for the rest of the week, then the rest of the month.

Things are OK right now. But I’m still hoping for something better.
