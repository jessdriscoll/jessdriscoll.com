Why won't you ever be the first one to break?  
I do. I broke.

What am I supposed to do now?  
You know. You suppose the worst.

Where did you go at the end of it all?  
We left. We end it all.

When will I know that it’s safe to return?  
It was. It wasn’t.

How did this happen all over again?  
This happened. This is over.
