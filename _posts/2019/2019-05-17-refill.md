Because I was counting on a new prescription yesterday, I only ordered a 30-day supply of my meds last month. Now, I have two pills left. 

The automatic pharmacy system works great—if you want exactly what you got last time. You call in, punch in the number on the bottle, and it reorders without you having to talk on the phone to a real person. This is perfect for people with anxiety.

Except, a few months ago, there was a shortage of 150mg pills. It’s a very common dose, and it’s mine, too. I was happy to take 2x75mg, but then I did the automatic refill and got exactly the same. So I had to call. 

Also, automatic doesn’t work for day-of pickups, and I’m going to my parents’s tonight. We have another family funeral tomorrow, and I’ll definitely be needing my meds.
