I have two tiny colourful volumes of cat illustrations by [Niina Aoki](https://www.etsy.com/shop/niinaaokishoppe). The first is only heads; the second is full body portraits. They’re so fine and delicate. The covers are patterned all over, and the binding is covered in washi tape. They’re so pretty!

These particular zines are no longer available in Niina’s shop, but [you can now buy her illustrations as a colouring book!](https://www.etsy.com/ca/listing/253536121/50-cats-of-perth-the-colouring-book)
