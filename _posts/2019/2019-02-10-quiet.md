The snow on Friday was just a teaser. Today, it started late morning and hasn’t stopped yet. Though I’m not looking forward to getting to work tomorrow, it’s been a beautiful backdrop to this quiet Sunday. Hopefully today will be the last day I’m sick (and if it was also the last day of my cycle, Monday can get started on the right foot).
