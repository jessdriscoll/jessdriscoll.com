Over the holidays, while I was at my parents’s house, I asked my landlord to hold onto my mail for me. Apparently I’ve been too quiet since I came back two weeks ago because she just asked if I was home for a delivery tonight. 

For my birthday, I bought myself some brand new basics: underwear, socks, and bras in plain blacks and whites. Now that I finally received them, I can continue with 2019’s plan to get rid of half my stuff. Tomorrow, I toss the old and start new.
