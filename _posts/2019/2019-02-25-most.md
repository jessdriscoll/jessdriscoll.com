Yesterday, I got into bed about 9. I’m trying very hard to create a bedtime routine: no reading, no eating, no phone, no alarms. I go to sleep when I’m tired; I get up when I’m awake. 

So far, it’s been working better than I expected. No matter what time I go to sleep, I’ve been up by 6 every morning. I’m lucky that I don’t need to get to work in the morning, but I’d still like to make better use of my free time. That’ll be the next goal. 

Unfortunately, last night, I got into bed before I wrote a blog post. I remembered before I fell asleep; I thought about getting up to write. But I really didn’t want to get out of bed. Yesterday was the second day in February I’ve missed. 

Though I was excited to complete January with a blog post every single day, I know it’s not possible to expect the same for a whole year. I know how hard that kind of schedule is. When I did my zine-a-week project in 2015-16, and then zine-a-day last August, I was more than happy to be done. 

When a friend asked how I felt at the end, I said, “I’m happy I did it, and I’m happy it’s over.”

On my 2019 list of goals, I wrote “blog most days” because I know myself. A goal too big will only make me feel sad when I fail. A goal too small won’t make me feel anything. 

Most days is right in the middle, which is good because blogging is my happiest medium.
