A few months ago, I got an email from Aaron Moran, who had seen my zines online and wanted to collaborate. He runs a tiny press in a city not too far from mine—coincidentally, not too far from where my grandparents moved two years ago.

We made that zine, and yesterday, we had the chance to meet in person. He gave me copies of [our collaboration](https://poorquality.ca/WHITE-ROCK-PARKS), as well as one of his own new projects. [Fixation Drills](https://poorquality.ca/FIXATION-DRILLS) is a series of what we might call ASCII art, if it hadn’t been produced on a typewriter. Symbols and typography, repetition  and shape. 

I learned how to type—home row!—on electric typewriters in high school, and I have a small portable Brother machine that I often use as decoration when I table at art shows. The way young kids today react when they get a chance to press those keys, it’s a reminder of how much has really changed in my lifetime. 

Fixation Drills has a bit of that nostalgia for me. A reminder of typing speed contests and making up new sentences with every letter in the alphabet. The words we could create on our upside down calculators and the more elaborate drawings on graphical calculators. A tactile reminder of the past.
