I have a 7-year-old student who is here with her 4-year-old sister and their grandma, while the rest of the family is in China. They live across the street and, on days we share classes, give me a ride home. 

Sometimes, we get dinner first. Tonight, we ate at the Chinese restaurant below my office. At the end of the meal, the cookies they bring are crispy fried things made with coconut or rolled in sesame seeds. Thereâ€™s no paper fortune to take home, but I still feel lucky.
