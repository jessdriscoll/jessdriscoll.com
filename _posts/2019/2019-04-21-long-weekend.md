This is a very long weekend, made longer because my parents postponed Easter dinner. I should be eating ham and scalloped potatoes today. I keep forgetting it’s only Sunday. Tomorrow is a day off, too. 

Yesterday, I thought about going downtown. Then I realised it was 4/20, and the first since legalization. Vancouver was already a marijuana friendly city; I imagine yesterday was insufferable. 

So I went out today, with a destination in mind, but not quite sure how I would get there. It was two buses, three trains, a stop for lunch, and then a walk. I did the Coquitlam Crunch for the first time. 437 stairs, straight up, 15 minutes. The trail goes on, up again, but in gravel. Maybe next time. 

I walked to the mall instead. It’s summer weather already. I’m wearing a tank top, and a guy at a kiosk asked me what it says. “We are the granddaughters of the witches you could not burn.” He says, “Cool. Are you Wiccan?” I tell him, no, I’m a feminist.
