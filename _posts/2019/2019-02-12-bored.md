This morning I was bored, staring down another snow day stuck inside. I gave this blog post its title, but before I could write anything, I heard from my boss that they’d decided not to cancel classes. 

I definitely wasn’t bored after trekking uphill through the snow and teaching three classes of kids on Day 4 off from school.
