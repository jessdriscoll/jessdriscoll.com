I met [Isabella Medina](https://www.ismedina.com/work) when we were both tabling at Euzine last year. A beautiful woman in a soft pink power blazer, wearing her own handmade FUCK TRUMP earrings. She came by my table first, then invited me over for a trade.

I took home her Backpack Zine, a simple tiny accordian-fold zine of drawings. Blue lines on blue cardstock. Eight different backpacks. We love backpacks in the PNW.

It doesn’t fit nicely in the wooden IKEA desk organiser where I keep all my zines, so it sits on the shelf as it’s own piece of art.
