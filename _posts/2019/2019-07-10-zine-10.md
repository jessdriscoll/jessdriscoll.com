The smallest zine in my collection is 16 pages, 2” wide and 3” tall. The title is Twt #3: Things I Dislike, and that’s just what it is: a list of terrible things. Some highlights include: spiders, split ends, and the smell of burnt bacon. 

If I’m reading the email address on the back cover, this zine was made by Catherine Elms](https://catherineelms.co.uk/about/), who is now making music!
