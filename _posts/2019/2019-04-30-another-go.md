Humans, as a whole, love to watch the calendar turn over. We love to forget the past and start again. Every day is new. Every month, another chance to get it right.

There’s a bit of magic in the new year’s turn from December to January. This time, we promise, we’re gonna do the thing. But if you haven’t done your thing yet, don’t despair.

We all get another go at it tomorrow, with the beginning of May. 

My thing is the same thing, the thing that’s been rattling around my brain for nearly 20 years. After a lifetime of research, I still don’t know how or if I’ll ever get it done. But a new idea came to me today and a new month starts tomorrow.
