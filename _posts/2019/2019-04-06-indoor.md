After an unexpectedly extroverted week, I needed an indoor day: pjs, naps, tea, TV, as well as a few necessary chores. I didn’t know how tired I was until I woke up this morning. I had coffee and oatmeal, but then I went back to bed. The weather wasn’t great, anyway, so there wasn’t much else to do. Might take a break from reading because I couldn’t settle into a book; I tried more than one. 

Tomorrow night is burlesque life drawing, and if it doesn’t rain, I might walk the Seawall first. I really miss my art gallery membership. But then I also think, I should see a different part of the city. I’ve been exploring Vancouver my whole life, and I still haven’t seen it all.
