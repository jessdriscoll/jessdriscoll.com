1. So it’s raining again. 

2. I didn’t do a whole lot today. That’s fine; it’s OK, but yeah, I still feel kinda guilty. 

3. I just couldn’t settle into reading. That always happens when I finish one book, then pick up another—already in progress. Finding my way back in doesn’t happen automatically. 

4. But I made soup with the leftover roasted broccoli and limp spinach, as well as a Parmesan rind from the freezer. 

5. So that’s one thing I did today.
