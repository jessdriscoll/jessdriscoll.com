I didn’t know how much I was missing music until I started listening to it again. Buying AirPods to go with my new phone definitely helped. Sometime in the last few years, all earbuds had grown uncomfortable (do ears change shape as you age?!?), and also, probably, depression killed a lot of my love. 

Music was an important part of my childhood. Then I was just happy listening to RUMOURS over and over again. 

I spent my day off today editing metadata. My digital library isn’t nearly as well-organised as my family’s CD collection (currently in bins during renovations, but still mostly alphabetical). Hours digging into old favourites, rating the best, deleting the least, syncing a five-star playlist to my phone. 

Happiness is on shuffle and never wanting to skip a song.
