Once a month, I host an art class at the library. This month, it was last night. Nobody came. Nobody came last month either. 

It’s disappointing, but I’m trying not to be sad about this. I’m trying to be persistent and not give up because it’s hard to get attention. I started Art Space because I believe there are people who want to make art, but they don’t know how to start and they’re afraid to make mistakes. 

(I also started it because I have art supplies that are literal decades old and deserve to be used, but nobody needs to know that.)

I know how hard it is to try something new. I know how many things I haven’t done because I’m scared. So this time, I’ll be the patient one, and I’ll be at the library next month, waiting for that person to come looking to make their art.
