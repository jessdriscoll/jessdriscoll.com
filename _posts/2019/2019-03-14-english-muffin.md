Almost the first thing I cook every time I stay at my parents’s house is a fried egg sandwich. English muffins are a staple; if they’re not in the fridge already, I’m sure to find them in the freezer. Split and toast while I melt butter in a pan. 

Once the butter is sizzling, crack an egg. Salt and pepper on top, then cover with a lid. The English muffin will pop just before the egg is ready, enough time to prep it with whatever you like: cheese, tomato, ham, spinach. 

This morning, I made mine simple, with just cream cheese. Tomorrow, I make it different.
