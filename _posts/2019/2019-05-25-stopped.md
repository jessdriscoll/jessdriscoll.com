An indoor day, thanks to rain. A day when I don’t have to wear a bra, I can drink multiple pots of tea, I have enough time to finally watch Beyoncé’s HOMECOMING, as well as get a few chores done. I also redesigned this website, and I’ve finished uploading all my blog entries from 2010. Only eight more years to go.

And the rain has stopped.
