I had my day off all planned out. But then my grandparents dropped in. I don’t see or hear from them as much since they moved to the valley. Instead of being 20 minutes away, now they’re an hour and a long distance phone call away. 

But after 40 years, they kept their doctors here, so there are occasional visits. Today, they took me to lunch. 

I still can’t believe they’re 82. Then again, I don’t always believe I’m 37.
