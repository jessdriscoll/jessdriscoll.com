It’s only 7:30, but I already want to go to bed. I got up at 6:30 this morning. Not that it was a busy day. The snow has melted just enough that a walk around the block didn’t feel treacherous. But mostly I read. I made some chocolate puffed wheat squares. 

My sleep schedule has been off for months. Recently, I’ve started sleeping in short bursts, never through the night. I wake up early, too early, no matter what time I fell asleep. So I’d like to create a routine. 

No phone in bed is the most important rule. No reading is harder, but I’ll try. Get up when I wake up; no more lounging. 

Go to sleep when I’m tired, even if it’s 7:45 at night. 

(But not before I post. I got out of bed to write this.)
