I haven’t yet decided how to BUILD what I want. My dreams still feel too expensive. Rather, costly, because I know they have to cost money, but right now, it’s just more than I have. 

I want to build a morning routine and a yoga practice. I want to build an independent arts curriculum. I want to build a brick-and-mortar shop to show and sell my art. 

But first, I want to build this website. That’s the easiest first step. Keep blogging every day. Work at getting the archives back online. Make my name dot com the place where people can find me.
