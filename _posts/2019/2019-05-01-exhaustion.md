It’s been a while since I’ve worked five days a week, and I forgot how much it can be. Yesterday, I felt bad about skipping skating, but tonight, I’m recognising it was the right decision. I’m tired. I’ll probably skip life drawing, too. 

Depression starts in your brain, but it affects your whole body. It’s emotional and physical exhaustion. The constant running of my mind makes everything else more difficult. 

So I’ll make this short and try to sleep.
