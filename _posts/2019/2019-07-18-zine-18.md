Most of the zines in my library have a story attached—the place I was, the creator I met, the website I found. The D.I.Y.

Understandable, issue #3 is from 2011. “Publishing is rad,” proclaims one headline. I agree, but I also know how hard it is to stay on schedule. 

But inspiration lives forever. Inside, there are stories of an independent print shop, a singer-songwriter, a carpenter/comedian, and the illustrator who drew the cover. People keep making, and some of us make it, and some of us don’t. But we keep trying.
