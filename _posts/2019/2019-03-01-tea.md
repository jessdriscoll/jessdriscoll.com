One time, I wrote a blog post telling the internet how to make tea the proper British way, and I got flamed so hard, Tumblr enshrined the post as one of the best of the year (category: weird).

But for all the people who complain their tea is cold now because they forgot they made it, here’s a story:

I made tea last night, about 7:30. I have a Brown Betty teapot that used to belong to my grandma (the not-British one) and a tea cosy she sewed for me. When I got up this morning to make tea for breakfast (I’m currently out of coffee), my tea from last night was still warm. 

That’s why I make tea like an imperialist. Sorry. 

(I made a new pot, don’t worry.)
