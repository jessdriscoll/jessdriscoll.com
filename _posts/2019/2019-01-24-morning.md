I’ve never been a morning person. I’m trying not to be a night owl. But even when I get to sleep at a reasonable hour, I don’t like getting up in the morning. 

There’s an expectation that one should get up early and get to work. But I don’t go to work until 3pm. So I put a lot of pressure on myself to use my free time well. The pressure doesn’t help. (Of course.)

I have one small job in the morning. I do a short English conversation phone call at 10am. It’s the perfect place to draw a line in my schedule. 

My day officially starts at 11am. That gives me time for breakfast, conversation, shower, and whatever dragging of my feet I need to do. Then at 11, I sit down at my desk and write. Just a few pages in my notebook to start, but it’s enough to give me a push. 

I feel good about this routine, though it’s very new. If it lasts a month, I’ll move the start time to 10.
