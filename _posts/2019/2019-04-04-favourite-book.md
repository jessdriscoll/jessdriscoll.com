A grade 3 student asked me today, What’s your favourite book? I told him that’s a really hard question to answer. 

Then his twin brother asked about my “worst” book. That’s even harder. 

The easy answer is “I can’t choose!” But no kid wants to hear that. I told them I love ROMEO AND JULIET, but they don’t know what that is. What kind of answer are they hoping for?

My classes are based around a library of about 200 books, mostly the Caldecott and Newberry winners, grouped by reading level. I haven’t read them all, but I know them all after four years of teaching. And still my students are amazed by this. 

Perhaps they’re hoping my favourite book might be amongst the handful they’ve read.
