The last time I filled my prescription, the exact dose wasn’t available. So instead of 150mg capsules, they gave me twice the number of 75mg capsules. No big deal. 

I use the pharmacy’s touch tone ordering system. You call the number, enter your prescription number and phone number, and your medication is ready in two days. It’s perfect for anxious people like me who don’t like phone calls. 

But it means I have an exact copy of my last prescription: twice the number of 75mg capsules instead of 150s. Oh well. No big deal.
