1. As soon as I typed “monday” as the title of this post, I started singing “Monday Morning” by Fleetwood Mac in my head. 
2. I accidentally took a break from blogging this weekend. Saturday, I left early and tried to go hiking. But the wind was too strong to be outside. I genuinely forgot to post. 
3. On Sunday, my family did a belated Easter dinner. That night, lying in bed, I thought about posting, but all I had was a title: “gale-force.”
4. I figured, if I didn’t post yesterday , at least I could write today about how it’s important to take a break, even from good habits. 
5. You can always start your streak over again.
