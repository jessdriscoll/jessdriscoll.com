Another selection from my trading at Euzine: Ode to a Raisin by Caden Sage. I picked this one up off the table because of the adorable dog portrait on the cover, as well as that intriguing title. 

Completely hand-written and drawn, this zine is a fitting tribute to what reads like the best dog companion. Included is a “Raisin-approved” playlist, Raisin’s multiple nicknames, and sentimental memories.

I was afraid this might be a sad zine—an elegy—but no! Raisin is still alive and being the best dog a human could want. I only hope my own future pet will be as worthy of a zine as Raisin.

(I could not find this author or zine online, so if you know them and they have links, please let me know!)
