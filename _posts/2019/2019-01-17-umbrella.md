In this part of the world, you don’t leave the house before checking the weather forecast. Especially if, like me, you don’t have a car. I need to know if it’s going to rain because I need to know what to wear and what to bring. 

A portable umbrella is essential. I have a new one: light blue with yellow pineapples. It’s very cute. 

It’s also become completely useless. 

The wind this season has been so strong, so relentless, it not only caused millions of dollars in damage to boats and destroyed our pier, but I can’t walk with an umbrella anymore. My cute pineapple umbrella already has two broken spokes. 

So I walked home in the rain tonight. I hung up my coat, hat, and scarf to dry overnight. 

It’s supposed to rain all weekend.
