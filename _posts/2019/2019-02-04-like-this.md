I expected *The Queen’s Throat* to be typical non-fiction. I didn’t know the author, Wayne Koestenbaum, is also a poet. 

I struggled long as a writer because I couldn’t find myself in the canon. When I discovered the internet and blogging, I fell hard because it was exactly how my brain worked. I write like this. 

Wayne Koestenbaum writes like this, too. Just now, I went looking to see if he has a blog. I found this: ['Oh! kangaroos, sequins, chocolate sodas!': Frank O'Hara's Excitement](https://m.poets.org/poetsorg/text/oh-kangaroos-sequins-chocolate-sodas-frank-oharas-excitement)

*The Queen’s Throat* is written exactly like this. This kind of writing is why I love Whitman. It’s why I love *Paterson*. It’s why I love reading artists’s journals. It’s why I’m back to blogging, 17 years after I started.
