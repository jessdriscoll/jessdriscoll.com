My todo list for 2019 is as long as a single notebook page. I don’t know how many items are on the list; I just filled all the lines. Some are carried over from last year; a few are brand new. They’re not all related to my BUILD theme. They’re just a few things to check off over the next months. 

This weekend, I’ve been working on getting rid of half my stuff. That’s an imprecise number because I don’t know exactly what needs to go. That’s half the problem. I have stuff living in boxes I haven’t opened in too long. Now I have two boxes and a bag to donate. 

My goal for the next week is don’t leave the house without taking something to drop off. If I’m going to BUILD in 2019, I’m gonna need the space.
