The non-obvious thing about every book I’ve tried to read over the last month is how upsetting they were. PAX by Sara Pennypacker is about a young boy forced to give up his pet fox. Colson Whitehead’s UNDERGROUND RAILROAD is about U.S. slavery. Margaret Atwood’s CAT’S EYE is about female bullying. Everything I read about Zelda Fitzgerald is about mental illness. 

Before I give up on reading for the rest of the year, I went looking for something short—poetry—at my library. The ebook selection is incredible, so I sorted by year and started downloading. Apparently, the limit is ten. 

I’ll start here and see where it leads me.
