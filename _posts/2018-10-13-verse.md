Amy Lowell’s first poetry collection, *A Dome of Many-Coloured Glass*, has a section of verse for children!

>It's a little bit sad, when you seem very near  
>To adventures and things of that sort,  
>Which nearly begin, and then don't; and you know  
>It is only because you are short.

When I was very young, I adored A. A. Milne’s poems (with illustrations by E. H. Shepard). I had a boxed collection of his two poetry books and two Winnie-the-Pooh books, but I read the poems again and again. They were so simple, but so clever. The rhythm and rhyme, delightful. I can hear them in my head even now. 

Here’s Amy Lowell, an unmarried heiress with no children, a respected poet and editor with famous friends, and after a selection of free verse and sonnets, she includes her rhythmical verse for children in her first published collection. 

I aspire to this level. Me, I’d probably invent a ridiculous pseudonym to publish my nonsense rhymes. Amy Lowell threw everything into one book, and she was right. 

I didn’t quote the free verse or the sonnets. I quoted these four lines because they’re delightful, and they made me smile.
