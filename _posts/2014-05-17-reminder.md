I’ve set a reminder for the 15th of every month: Make a zine. If I haven’t figured out my zine-a-month by then, I have half a month to do it. I was thinking I’d write something about hockey. The Canucks aren’t in the Playoffs this year, so it’s just fun to watch. I don’t care who wins. I only wanted the Bruins to lose, and they’re already done. 

But without the investment, the interesting stories are harder to hang onto. I could write something about Crosby v. Toews, but I think the sportswriters have that covered. There’s something to be said about Teemu Selanne, the oldest man in the league, who just lost his chance for one more Cup.

Instead, I find myself turning to cycling a little earlier this year. There’s the Giro d'Italia, the Tour of California, and another old man, Jens Voigt, 42 and still riding.

I love this monthly challenge because I have a lot of ideas. I have a lot of ideas spread across a lot of text files and notebooks, and the only way to get them out of my head is to make them. And the only way to make them is one at a time.
