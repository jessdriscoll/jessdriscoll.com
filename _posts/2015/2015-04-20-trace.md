Something you learn in Girl Guides is “leave no trace”. When you go into the woods, everything you bring, you have to pack out. That means garbage, but also filling tent peg holes and being mindful of how you use trees to tie up tarps and supplies. Leave your camp to the wilderness for the next group to use, be they human or animal.

I hope someone on the trail behind me found my sketch and picked it up. Enjoyed it for a few moments at least. Because I left it for them.
