I'm a word person, so I had just assumed sudoku was about math. It's actually a puzzle in the old fashioned sense of putting pieces where they fit. Those pieces could be anything. In sudoku, they're numbers.

Right now, it's the perfect game for my brain. A bit of mindless distraction between the words.

Just fill in the boxes, 1-9, in each column, in each row, in each third. Easy, right?
