THIS IS MY HARVEST BOX.

$15. 10lbs of local produce.

one zucchini, one cucumber, three yellow bell peppers, three beefsteak tomatoes, five red potatoes, five Spartan apples, one bunch radishes.

THIS IS WHAT I MADE WITH IT.

BIG SALAD

Slice half zucchini lengthwise into thin, flat strips. Char in pan, then dice. Cube leftover bread and sauté with olive oil, salt, and dried summer savoury (my pepper grinder ran out as I was cooking). Chop one pepper, half cucumber, a few radishes, one tomato, and an inch of the white of a leek. Toss vegetables and croutons with vinaigrette.

BALSAMIC VINAIGRETTE

Add the last few tablespoons of olive oil in the bottle to the balsamic vinegar left in the jar after finishing the pickled onions. Add a dollop of grainy mustard, salt, and dried summer savoury. Tighten the lid and shake well.

UDON & PEANUT SAUCE

To the last tablespoon of peanut butter in the jar, add soy sauce, grated ginger and garlic, fish sauce, sambal oelek, and a bit of the pasta water. Shake carefully. Toss the sauce with udon noodles and leftover BIG SALAD. Top with shredded basil and crushed peanuts.

POLENTA & TOMATO SAUCE

Chop leeks, garlic, bell pepper, and zucchini, and sauté. When softened, add crushed tomatoes, dried summer savoury, and a spoonful of pesto. Simmer. Pour over soft polenta and top with basil.

OATMEAL

Pour boiling water over quick oats and a pinch of salt. Core and dice apples. Cook in a pan with crabapple butter until the apple pieces are coated and soft. 

HASHBROWNS & GREENS

Grate one potato. Toss with BALSAMIC VINAIGRETTE. Cook on medium high heat for as long as you can stand not playing with it. Let the potato get crispy. Flip, and let it get crispier. Keep warm in a low oven while you sauté the greens in the same pan. Chop leeks, kale, and grate a clove of garlic. Steam with a splash of vegetable stock. Serve on top of the hashbrowns.

PANZANELLA

Chop tomatoes. Toss with leftover croutons and BALSAMIC VINAIGRETTE. Top with basil.

COUSCOUS SALAD

Roast halved peppers, then steam and remove the skins. Chop finely. Make couscous with boiling water. Remove seeds from cucumber and dice. Mix vegetables with couscous, season with salt and pepper, and dress with BALSAMIC VINAIGRETTE.

APPLE CRUMBLE

Core and dice apples. Toss with berry jam and crushed shortbread cookies. Pour into shallow dish, and bake at 350.

VEGETABLE STOCK

Don't compost your radish tops, pepper stems, leek roots, and cucumber seeds. Collect all trimmings in a large jar kept in the freezer. When it's full, bake 10 minutes at 400. Cover with water in a pot. Add bay leaf and peppercorns. Bring to a boil, then lower the heat and simmer, at least an hour. Strain and keep in the fridge for a week.

Use stock to make soup, boil pasta, loosen sauces, steam vegetables, wilt greens, cook beans, add flavour to everything you cook.

YOU CAN COOK ANYTHING.
