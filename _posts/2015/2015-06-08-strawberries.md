My grandma asked if I wanted a basket of strawberries; she brought me ten pounds. I made this quick cobbler with a few tablespoons of butter, a scant cup of flour, a teaspoon of baking powder, pinch of salt, all rubbed together with my fingers. Add enough cold tap water just to bring it all together. Then spread over a pie plate filled with topped and chopped strawberries. Bake at 350 until the cobbler is browned and the strawberries are bubbling.
