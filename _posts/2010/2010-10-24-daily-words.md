So, I fell asleep last night, having written a measly 134 words. But today will be better. That's the thing with writing--you can't give up just because the situation isn't perfect. Just keep writing. Keep writing. Get back up out of the dirt and pick up your bat again. Swing for the fences. Today, or tonight, rather, I'm not letting myself have dessert until I finish writing. And I'm going to make myself write one thousand words. Too often, I let myself off the hook at 750 because that's the goal of the site. But that's not my goal. My goal is at least one thousand every day until November 1st. And after that, my goal is two thousand words a day. So I have some work to do. 

I don't have any big ideas yet because I need to start writing to get a handle on the characters. Writing a little something from the future of my story usually helps. The way I usually write is percolating for a long time, until I have a kickass first sentence, then meandering along a vague storyline until an amazing scene pops into my head, and I have to go write that one right away, even if it's the last scene.
