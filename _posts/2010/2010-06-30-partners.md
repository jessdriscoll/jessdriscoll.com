I've been waiting for some decent promos, but the extra stuff they shot with Matt Bomer and Tim DeKay is actually better than the season two footage. [The last shot here, just their feet, kills me.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkY3v1PK2WU) (I'm gonna assume everyone's seen the WHITE COLLAR/PSYCH promo, [but just in case](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yx0bb6tzDVI).)
