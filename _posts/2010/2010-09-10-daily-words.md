I like the days I work 1-9, even if I do end up staying in bed and on the computer until 11:30. Today, a little later than that because it's 11:22 now, and I need to get this written before I go. But I've had breakfast and I've showered. Just need to get dressed and grab my stuff. Don't need a big lunch, just this container of nuts and an applesauce will do me. It's raining today. It'll probably rain all day. It'll be cold. I should wear a sweater. I'll have to remember to bring my pen.

I'm actually really kind of excited about this online library course I've applied for. The jobs start at $24/hr, which is more than double what I'm making now, and it's a much better environment for me. Fewer people, for one. Less stress. I don't know that I'm going to last a year at this job. It's not killing me the way the factory did. I don't feel that soul sucking I did there. But it is intense and overwhelming. I feel like it's all I can do to keep up. And I need to be writing more. I already hate that I'm making excuses.
