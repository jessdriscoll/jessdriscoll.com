I'm just really really tired. I don't want to have to deal with 750 words, but it's good practice for November. There are going to be a lot of days when I just don't want to write. But I'm going to want to make word count, right? Those days, I'm just going to have to suck it up and write. My eyes are falling asleep of their own volition. I think I might write the rest of this session without looking. I don't care enough. I just don't want to walk all the way home. I don't know. When did this story become a--all right. I keep looking and the sentence makes sense. It's that weird feeling when, in your dream, you can't scream but you need to.
