Because it's the first day of writing, the first session, the first words, I'm letting myself pick a prompt, rather than just choosing randomly. I think random will be better than starting at the top of the list and working down. Much more of an in 'verse feeling. So the plan is to wake up, turn on my computer, pick a number, and start writing before anything else. No checking email or tumblr or blogs. Just write. Like I'm going to do right now.
