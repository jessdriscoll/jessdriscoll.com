On a sunny Canada Day, I went downtown to watch the Yaletown Grand Prix.

After starting at the line with 59 other category 1 riders, Svein Tuft was already 29 seconds away when the race had to be called to let in an ambulance. (Everyone’s fine.) Only 20 were left when they started again. Tuft went away and stayed away. No one could catch him, not even his Garmin-Transitions teammate, Christian Meier.

He lapped the field. The commentators took up a quick collection, nearly 300 dollars to spur him on to lap the peloton again. He couldn’t quite do it, but I think we got our money’s worth.
