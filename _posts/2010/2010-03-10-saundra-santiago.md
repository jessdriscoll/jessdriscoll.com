1. I just figured out that Cristian's mom on One Life to Live is played by [Saundra Santiago](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0763639/), formerly Detective Gina Calabrese of Miami Vice. 

2. With Owen Pallett making music these days, I hadn't realised how much I miss [Rufus Wainwright](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbRFcP--I6Y). 

3. If I spent half as much time looking for the right chair that I spent looking for the right notebook, I'd have twice as many words written.
