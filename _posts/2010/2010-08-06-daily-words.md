God, the biggest problem is that I don't often find books I want to spend money on. That's what's wrong with this industry. If this is really what I want to do, I have to be willing to support it. But I don't often find books I like. That's why I want to write. Because I can't find the things I want to read. The things I want to read are overwhelmingly fan fiction. That's how I've chosen some of the e-books. Because I know the writers from fic, so I know what they can do. I know they're worth it. I'm not a big fan of them filing off the serial numbers, but oh well.

For me, a lot of my original ideas start as fic. That's just where my brain goes first. I've been in fandom since I was 14, reading. I started writing in 2002. That's just where my ideas start. But, lately, they've very quickly become original. I write weird AUs, anyway. I like contemporary settings, and some of the best fandoms are genre. 

These days, more than any in my writing career, I think about how things can be novels. I never used to think that way. It was, for the longest time, about what can be a TV show. I still want to write for TV, but it's so hard to break into. Novels are easy. I mean, they're not, but they are. I can start by sending it out to anyone, to agents, to houses, to e-book publishers. That's easy. Writing the thing is hard. I've never written over ten thousand words. That's the first test. Then twenty, then thirty, then whatever makes a novella. Really, my first challenge should be to write a novella. Or an extended collection of short stories. 

I have a few short story deadlines coming up, which has to be the priority. But if I'm ever going to write a novel, I need to be working on it at the same time. I know I can bang out 750 words. Can I work on 1000 words at the same time? Can I write 1750 words a day?
