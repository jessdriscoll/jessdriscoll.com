I realised today that I have too many pseudonyms already. If I’m really back in fandom—and I am, let’s face it. Sometimes, I just want a place to talk about these really specific things that only fit in fandom. I’ll probably write fic again, and I want it to be in my own name. My own fandom name, of course.

It’s May. Don’t all my new projects start in May and November?

I didn’t write at all today, which is depressing. I’ll try to poke at the story a little tonight. I caught up on CSI instead today.

Fandom is my comfort place, but it’s just not doing it for me lately. I think that’s the main motivation behind writing these romance stories. Not only the money, but because I’m not getting it from fandom anymore. I have to make my comfort myself now.
