Tonight, I'm going to do this right. I put off last night until it was too late. I didn't remember until there were less than ten minutes left until midnight. And there's nothing can do with less than ten minutes. Well, that's not true. I can write. I can write a whole of lot words in ten minutes, but I've proven so far that I can't write 750. For that, I need at least twelve minutes.
