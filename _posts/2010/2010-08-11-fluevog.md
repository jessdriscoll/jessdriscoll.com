From the Fox, Fluevog, and Friends exhibit at the Museum of Vancouver: a piece of beat up dot matrix computer paper with a sketch by John Fluevog, and underneath he's written, You may not like these shoes--too bad. I do. 

It looks like you can't buy my favourite pair of Fluevogs anymore. I bought a pair of black and white Michaels eleven years ago to go with the suit I sewed for high school graduation. I don't care much about shoes. Mostly, I wear runners with the soles worn through. But I love my Fluevogs.
