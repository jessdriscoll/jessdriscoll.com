Today felt like a full day. Put some stuff up on etsy for The General. Poked a little at the story (my goal is just to write every day, not matter how little). Then downtown for a Shakespeare lecture at SFU. I was not surprised at all that my brain started imagining a series about travelling actors, tragedians. When I’m supposed to be quiet and listening is when I do all my best thinking. I’d love to see it set in Shakespeare’s time—a kind of prequel to SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE.

I want to take the small business class at Kwantlen. Maybe in the fall, if it’s offered. But I at least want to look at the new books they’ve brought in. So I’m gonna head over there tomorrow, do a little autodidacting.
