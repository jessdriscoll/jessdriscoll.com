Bear with me a moment: ["All For Love"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofA3URC1wyk) is an amazing music video. It's a movie theme song, yet there's not one clip from THE THREE MUSKETEERS. It's my favourite kind of extended documentary-style video with everyone gathering in some empty theatre somewhere--Rod Stewart's late. There's dicking around on the piano, and Sting doing his Bryan Adams impression, as well as calling Rod an "old tart."¬ù There's also a dinner party in the middle. I want a whole hour of this video. (Oddly, this is the only Bryan Adams song on my iPod. I swear, I really am Canadian.)
