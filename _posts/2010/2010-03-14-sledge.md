When I bought the ticket--Ice Sledge Hockey - Preliminary Round - Group B Game--I just wanted to see Canada play. They're playing against Norway, who, I've discovered, has medalled at every games since sledge hockey was added. Canada has only missed the podium once (and that was a fourth place). My random Paralympics purchase turns out to be one helluva match-up.
