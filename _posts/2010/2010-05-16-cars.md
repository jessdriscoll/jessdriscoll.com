I have this weird memory of drawing cars in the children’s section of the Newton Public Library. The new library, too, so I wasn’t a kid; preteen, at least. But I have this memory of drawing—-designing, really—-a new style of car, drawing on big pieces of blank paper. Maybe it was homework.

But all my life, I’ve been interested in inventing, innovating, making. Apparently, it doesn’t even matter what. I just need that reassurance that it hasn’t all be done before. There are still things left to make in this world. Things left to make this world better.
