It’s not a habit yet, but I haven’t given up. I wonder if I should just post here when I think about it. As soon as I remember, open the tab and write. I’ll try it out. Finally got the garden done yesterday. I don’t know what it is I don’t like about gardening. I suppose it actually has a lot with having to do things my mom’s way, in my mom’s space. If this were my backyard, I’d turn the sand pit into the garden, because that’s what we see every day. It would force us to think about the garden more.

Lots of work to do for my first craft fair in my new incarnation. I’m gonna have The General stuff and Shirt & Tie stuff and zines and, oh!, maybe some photos. Awesome.
