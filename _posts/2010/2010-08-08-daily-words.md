If it still isn't working after this much rambling, this much trying, this much longhand and typing and finding a new venue to write, maybe it just isn't a story I need to be writing. Nano is in a few months, and I need to start rambling about it now if I'm going to write it in November.

I've never done Nano before. It's funny. My last big writing project started because I wanted to do something like Nano, and it worked. I started writing a list. Like I do. I wrote a list of the kinds of things I love in fic. I was doing what I do in every fandom ever: using the characters as my own ciphers. It really hit home how much I'm supposed to be an original writer. But I wanted to write something in fandom. It's where I feel comfortable, where I feel safe. That night, already November 1st, I put the list away and went to sleep, not really thinking about it. But the next day, it just happened. I set a schedule, and I started writing. 

I didn't even make myself hit 500 words. Just write every day. Write a story with these characters, with this prompt. Write it and post it on the same day. And it worked. It worked so much better than I ever expected. 30 straight days, and when I realised that I could hit 20 thousand words, the last day I wrote 1300. In one day! I don't do that. I never do that. But I did.

I can do it again. I know I can. I can start with one thousand, but that'll grow. This is a great resource to help me. 750 words rambling in the morning, than I write my one thousand words that day and into night. One thousand will become more. All you need to hit 50 thousand words is 1600 a day. I don't know, but it seems doable. It seems like all I need is a great idea that has a lot about it.
