1. Laying awake in bed last night, I got to thinking about the Tour de France and how  will be my fifth year watching. Five years, and I still haven't found a satisfying way to follow the rest of the cycling season. (I wish all my interests had a Daring Fireball.) So on an insomnia-fueled whim, I added [Cyclocosm](https://cyclocosm.com) to my Reader. This will be the year I watch the Giro! 

2. ["Spielberg wanted Toht to be a cyborg, with a metal arm that could transform into a flamethrower and machine gun."](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Indiana_Jones_characters#Arnold_Ernst_Toht) Do yourself a favour and don't read the List of Indiana Jones characters on Wikipedia.
