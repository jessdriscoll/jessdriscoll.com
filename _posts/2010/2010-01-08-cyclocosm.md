Laying awake in bed last night, I got to thinking about the Tour de France and how  will be my fifth year watching. Five years, and I still haven't found a satisfying way to follow the rest of the cycling season. (I wish all my interests had a Daring Fireball.) So on an insomnia-fueled whim, I added cyclocosm.com to my Reader. This will be the year I watch the Giro!
