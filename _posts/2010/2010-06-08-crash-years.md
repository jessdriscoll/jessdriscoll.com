TOGETHER is the first New Pornographers album wherein my favourite song is not written by Bejar or sung by Neko. They haven't made a video for We End Up Together yet, but [here's Crash Years](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KZANuDcRO4), the best Neko song on the album, and a clever Gondry-esque video (but directed by Sammy Rawal) that neatly gets around the fact that it's tough to get all the New Pornos in one room together.

The love you have for a hometown band is greater than the love of all other bands, maybe trumped only by the love you have for your favourite band at 15. My real purpose behind posting [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2bMKnuv_-k) of The New Pornographers on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon is to point out that Todd is wearing a Stanley Park Singing Exhibition t-shirt and to wonder if that means we can hope to see the best summer concert in Vancouver return.
