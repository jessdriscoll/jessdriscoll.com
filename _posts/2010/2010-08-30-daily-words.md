Sometimes I leave it until the very last fifteen minutes of the day. For some reason, I didn't write as soon as I woke up. It's not like I even slept in today. I was up before 9. But, I don't know. I just didn't feel like it. I wanted to read more than I wanted to write. That's been the overriding feeling these days. I haven't written significantly in a while.

I have an iPhone now. I bought it today. That's part of the reason I put off my 750 words. I knew I had a bus to catch, and a million things to do before then. This thing is going to save my life on workdays, I can already tell. Able to watch AWZ on the bus ride home, or maybe even on my lunch break. Depending. Photos. Lots of photos and lots more posting of photos. Never getting lost again when I'm out walking. Walking more, now that I know where I am and where I want to go. I predict great things.

Mostly, I think it'll help me write more. I have a couple of notebooks on the go right now, but I've already discovered the problem of writing on paper and writing on the computer. Nothing syncs. The iPhone syncs. Or it should. I haven't done a test yet. We'll see. We'll see tomorrow how easy it is to write. Actual sentences, not just notes. I wrote a few sentences to M today, the first thing I did with the phone. I need to look up long distance text messaging. Is that super expensive or are text messages just like emails? They should be. That's the biggest problem with having a phone. The people I really want to talk to are so far away.

I'm listening to the radio on this thing. That's weird. Suddenly I'm a person who listens to the radio. I want to be a person that keeps better tabs on hockey, and I'm hoping the cycling apps I've found will work out. I can watch my YouTube videos. I can play games. I can listen to music. I can do a lot of stuff that I kind of just stopped doing.

But the writing is most important. I need to write more. I need to write every day. Not just ramble. Rambling's good, but it has to lead me somewhere. Right now, I'm thinking about something about travelling players. You know, like in Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead. I watched Shakespeare in Love last night because we went to go see A Midsummer Night's Dream in Langley yesterday. It wasn't great theatre, but it made me think about how a lot of Shakespeare's plays are about groups of players. Travelling groups of players, usually, performing for kings or dukes or whomever will pay them. 

I've been writing it as if it's a place. But maybe it's not a place; it's a group. It's the ensemble, the people, that matter. Not the building. I like the idea of centering a series around a spot--think Central Perk--but if this is going to be a play instead, I think the meta about a group of players will work nicely. Maybe no one else will get it, but I'll love it. I love meta.

It was going to use public domain songs, but I had such a hard time finding public domain songs. And it was going to reference classic theatre. And it was going to be about writers and actors and dancers and singers and the people who pay them to make art. It become a little bit about politics for a moment there, but I just don't feel like I know enough to write what I wanted to write. 

I know a lot about the theatre. I wish I had the chance to take more theatre classes at university. Drama, I mean. But Kwantlen didn't offer anything. The closest we got was Shakespeare, and, honestly, I just don't think you can count him. He's inevitable. I can think of two classes, barring Shakespeare, that concerned themselves with drama. An early English that I can't even recall the number, but the teacher was Mary Griffin, and she did Shaw and Pinter with us. I must still have those books. Some of them, at least? Later, I did a guided study with Fred. I wanted to write about Tennessee Williams and Tony Kushner, so, technically, we called it Modern Theatre. Or something like that. Whatever it was called, it was an upper level, and it was basically the best class I ever took at Kwantlen. Which is funny because Fred also taught me Shakespeare.
