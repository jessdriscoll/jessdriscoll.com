I remembered I set up a portfolio on delicious today. It’s mostly defunct, but I’m getting it back on track. Tracking down my favourite facts posts for actual printing, and now I can add them to delicious. The biggest thing is getting my photos back on flickr. Did some major pruning today, a full go-through of 2009 and 2008. Granted, 2009 isn’t as big a folder as it should be, but I did grab the Guide photos from mom’s computer, so I’ve got those.

Made cookies without a recipe. Usually, I’ll use one as a guide, but today I just threw some butter, the last of the peanut butter, egg, vanilla, brown sugar, salt, flour, oats, chocolate chips together, and they turned out perfect. Really nicely salty, too. You get that nice crunch with kosher salt.

I want to start walking again, but, honestly, the biggest thing holding me back is that I don’t have the right clothes. I need a pair of sweatpants.
