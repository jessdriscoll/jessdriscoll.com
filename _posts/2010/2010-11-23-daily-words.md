I can't decide if I want to cheat tonight or not. I don't think I have 750 words in me. I haven't had a whole lot of words in me lately. It's pathetic, really. I haven't even broken 15k on my novel. I think 20 will have to be my revised monthly goal. I have tomorrow, or most of tomorrow. A couple of thousand more words is all I need. But how can I get that if I can barely get the 750 I need every night to ensure I get an X in that box?
