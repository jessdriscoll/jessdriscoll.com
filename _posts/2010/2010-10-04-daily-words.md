This is pretty much the absolute latest I can start typing and still make it before the deadline. Actually, I'm not even sure I can make the deadline. There was that one night where I was pretty sure I could make it, then, less than 50 words from the end, midnight hit. It sucked pretty bad. But tonight, I can do it. I think. I hope. I still want to write every day, and this is the best way I've found to make myself do it. 

The great thing about 750 words is that there is no break. Sure, you can skip days, but you don't get points for those days. They don't count. So you can't take a break. Because writing every day is what being a writer is about. Even if it's crap. It's all about the word count. It's all about getting them out and on the page and maybe they'll make sense at the end of the day. or the end of the year. But you can't think. I need to train myself not to care about mistakes, typos or spelling errors. 

Just then, I backspaced to fix something. And again. It's weird. I can't stop myself. It's actually how I learned to type, I think. I don't know how to type fast without using the backspace to fix things as I go. I don't know how to write without editing as I go. That's something I need to work on. I need to trust myself just to put words down, to get story out, and we'll fix it in post. That's the mantra. That's how I'm going to write this novel. It has to be more than 50k words. But I can do that no problem. I can do that in two months. Starting right now. Or very soon. 

Starting as soon as I get the bones figured out. This idea has evolved so much even in the last few days. But the funny thing is that it's actually taking the idea back to the beginning. All the way back to my beginning even. 

Once I get all the little bits figured out, then we can start writing.
