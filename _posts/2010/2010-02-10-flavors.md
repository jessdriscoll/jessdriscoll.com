I've lived and eaten here my whole life, and I'm still surprised by how many Asian restaurants are on [The New York Times's Flavors of Vancouver list](https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/interactive/2010/02/03/dining/vancouver-dining-guide.html). Or maybe disappointed by the lack of diversity is a better way to put it. (I'd still kill for a reservation at Tojo's, though.)
