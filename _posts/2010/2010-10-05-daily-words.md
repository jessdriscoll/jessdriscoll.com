I can't decide if I want to get up and go to the library tomorrow, pick up a copy of Hamlet, then go to work. I should really have a copy, but I don't. You know what? Maybe I'll stop at the bookstore before I start work tomorrow. They should have a cheap, but decent version of Shakespeare. Where's the Chapters? No, I think it's too far. I'd have to walk, and I don't feel like doing more than I need to. 

I wish I had trade paperback versions of all the Shakespeares. Actually, yeah. I'd rather wait and get a nice copy with a nice cover that I could buy all matching. I want the whole set of Penguin or Arden or something. Or, conversely, I wish I could find a version that works on my iPhone. For now. I still want nice versions. All I have is my big two-volume collected works, which is nice, and old, but not useful. Not when I'm going to be dipping in and marking up and pulling quotes and bits and generally cannibalising Shakespeare to write a young adult novel.
