1. I’m listening to a lot of music at the moment, which means I’m not reading or writing as much. I think it’s GLEE’s fault. Also, The Band.

2. Made amazing rice pudding: 1 can coconut milk, 1 can milk, bit of vanilla and sugar, 1 cup jasmine rice, then topped with pineapple, banana, cashews. I love canned pineapple because it means pineapple juice, but tonight I realised I can’t drink pop at all anymore. It’s too sweet and too much for me now. Which is nice, actually. Proof that you can give up the things you once loved.

3. The problem with listening to my five stars playlist is that I never want to turn it off. The next song is always a good one.

4. >After about three minutes, it became 'the thing' again.

Stewart Copeland, on that infamous The Police reunion show at Sting's 1992 wedding.
