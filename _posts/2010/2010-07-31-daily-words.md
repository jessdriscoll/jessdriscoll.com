I have a story I'm working on right now. Actually, I've been working on it for more than a month now. The original deadline was for July. I wrote and wrote and bashed my head against the desk, and just when I had given up that it would be finished and that it would be good, the deadline changed. Now it's due in August. It's my first deadline in August, so it's what I'm putting all my writing energy into. 

Well, almost all my writing energy. Some of it is going here, of course. (I'd love to see how fast I can get to 750 words. Don't think. Just type. Well, think enough to fix typos, because I can't stand to look at them. Or my eyes will constantly go to them until they are fixed.)
