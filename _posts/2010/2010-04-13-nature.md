1. >Nature repels art. Art is an urban pastime. It follows then that the uglier the city in our country, the more difficult to live in, the more artificial its pleasures and the bruising to the senses, the greater need its people will have for their own artifacts and art.

Sophy Burnham, from THE ART CROWD, writing in 1972, but putting so clearly into words why itâ€™s always been hard trying to make (and find other people who want to make) art in Vancouver. (This quote is in defense of New York City as the centre of the art world, by the way.)
