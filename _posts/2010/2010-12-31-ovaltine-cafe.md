If you watched The X-Files, you'll recognise this place from Jose Chung's From Outer Space. It's still there, on Hastings, in the worst neighbourhood in Vancouver, in Canada, probably. Since 1943, the Ovaltine Caf√© has been there, still with the neon, still with the lunch counter, still with the diner classics. I finally made it this year, just before Christmas, while I was in Chinatown buying presents. The place is just up the street. Follow the neon. The customers have changed, more mismatched second-and-thirdhand clothes than men in hats and ladies in gloves. But the waitresses treat everyone the same. Everyone needs a good breakfast. Everyone deserves a fresh start.
