It's time for my morning exercise. I have a lot of words to catch up on. The good thing is, though, that the writing seems to be coming easier. I wrote more than I expected on my phone after work last night. I should have written more last night, but I did get to 12k words. If I can get to 15k tonight, I'll feel better going into my busy weekend. I should be at 20k, maybe already at 20k today, I'll have to check. But I have time to catch up. 

That's the thing with the second week. You still feel like there's all the time in the world. You can't be too far behind yet because some time soon, there's going to be a 10k day that blows your stats out of the water. Honestly, I don't know that I have 10k days in me, but it's a nice thought. A couple of 5k days would suffice. They would get me where I need to be. It's still all just set-up right now. I'm still feeling my way around the world, but that's OK. That's how I write. That's how I find the plot. I have a lot of rough edges to run my finger along, find a place to add. Find a place that looks interesting, like it could use another metaphor or image or exchange. A lot of place could use more images, that's true. But I'm getting there. This is all still skeleton. 

Actually, I think all of November is about skeleton. Once I get the structure, then I can go back and start adding muscle, flesh, skin, even clothes. That's how I get the novel to something readable. It's all still potential. 

And there was something else I wanted to add, and now I can't remember it because I went on that aside. It was another book that I haven't added yet or something that I'm reading or what? Dammit. That really annoys me. I have these ideas a lot and in the process of finding a way to capture them, I lose them. I don't know how much easier I can capture something, other than recording it straight from my brain. But, of course, that is science fiction, and I don't care for science fiction. 

Whenever new ideas happen, I have to remind myself that there will always be time later to work on them.
