Since watching [Jonathan Groff singing "Larger Than Life"¬ù](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nF2OInRUj0), I've spent a good two days thinking about a remake of MY FAVORITE YEAR--mostly the movie (which, oddly, CBC used to air late night a lot) but with the best songs from the musical thrown in--starring Jonathan Groff as Benjy, the young comedy writer, and Kevin Kline, doing his best Douglas Fairbanks, as the has-been swashbuckling actor Benjy has to keep in line.
