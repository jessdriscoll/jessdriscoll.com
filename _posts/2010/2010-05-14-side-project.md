I love music that happens like this. [Béatrice Martin plays piano and sings in French; Jay Malinowski plays guitar and sings in English.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rV8ndxUMCEI) I don’t know how they met, but they did, wrote some songs, and a side project was born. They don’t even have a name for it yet.

Some days I think I could live off Canadian music for the rest of my life. It’s like watching fractals.
