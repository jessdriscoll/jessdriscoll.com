I have two prompts I need to finish writing. It's almost been a week. I knew when I took them that it would take me some time, but this is ridiculous. My computer and lack of internet connection isn't the only thing stopping me from writing. I'm stopping me from writing. I still hope to finish a story for the August 31 deadline, but I don't even remember now which deadline that is. A 1k story or a 3k story? I don't remember. I'm not going to be able to write my plan my littleroom. That's just not viable anymore.

With my old job, tutoring and going to school, jobs even if I wasn't getting paid much, I had a lot of time to sit and think. With this job, the only time I have time to sit is when I'm sitting at a machine and sewing. And I don't even have a lot of time to do that. Mostly it's customers. I can't believe how busy that place is. Why don't people just buy clothes that fit? It's amazing. Yes, OK, I understand why, but crazy. And I'm still boggled at how many people can't do simple repair jobs by themselves. Who pays to get a button sewn on?

I'm working, but it's the weekend, so there's a weird feeling. It feels like I should be able to come home and find a new ep of Alles was zahlt to watch. I can't believe this is only Sunday. I have to get through today, Monday, Tuesday, then I can rest. Then I'm working until 9. I wonder when I'll be able to settle into a routine. I just don't feel comfortable there yet. It gives me a pit in the bottom of my stomach. 

I'm trying this thing today where every paragraph is around 100 words. It just means that when I see that word counter down there in the right hand corner tick over to the next hundred, I start a new paragraph. A new paragraph should be about a new idea. It's a good exercise in coming up with ideas fast. Instead of writing about a new idea, I'm right now writing about my paragraphs. It's very meta. I love meta things, but I think I love metafiction best.
