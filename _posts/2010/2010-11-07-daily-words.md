This is just a little blah blah blah to get me to 750 words before midnight. I'm having a lot of trouble keeping up. It's partly the job, because I need the time to decompress afterwards and that doesn't leave a lot of time for writing. I've been procrastinating, because it's only day seven. I know I have lots of time to catch up in the end. Nano is 50k words in 30 days. It's not necessarily 1667 words every day. I may be behind now, but on Tuesday I could write four thousand words and pull way ahead. OK, I'd actually need more than four thousand to be way ahead, but I'd be on track, at least. 

It's not that I don't know where the story is going. I have some good ideas, and my scenes are really happening. They're actually getting longer than I anticipated which is nice. But I can already feel the disorganisation of the story. I know that there are mistakes, things I've written that I've then gone and contradicted, but I can't go back and change them. I won't. I spend too much time scrolling through the doc and deleting stuff as it is. 

I know I can get to 50k words. That's the thing. I know I can do it. I just don't know how long it's going to take me. But I like this story, I love the characters. I like that there's actually a lot to say. I didn't know that I could come up with a sustainable plot like this. I was actually starting to believe that I was destined to write one thousand word scenes the rest of my life.
