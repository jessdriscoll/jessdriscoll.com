A completely different, but not unrelated idea is that I want to explore HAMLET more. Shakespeare in general, I think, even though it's the most obvious thing ever. But I want my novel to have more HAMLET references. I just don't know what kind that aren't cliches. Little things, like the school. Maybe Adam is going to Wittenberg instead. Someone goes out and picks the same flowers Ophelia is talking about. Things like that.
