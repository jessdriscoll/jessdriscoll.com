I honestly don't know what I'm going to write about tonight, but I've got 16 minutes to get my 750 words. I sometimes feel like just sitting down and writing blah blah blah until I get that little green pop up box. Sometimes, that's all that comes out. Of course, I could be writing my Nano novel. I could be doing that, but I'm not.
