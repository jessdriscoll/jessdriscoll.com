2. The only thing I care about less than basketball is baseball, and, God, I hate to encourage Nike to sell more shit, but [here's a commercial soundtracked by Andre 3000 covering one of my favourite Beatles songs.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huHmHshx9g0) I grew up in the '80s; I am not immune to advertising.

I was only 9 when Freddie died, but Queen was, and still is, my dad's favourite band, and a huge part of my musical education. If I watched the concert then, I probably loved Spinal Tap's performance, or maybe Bob Geldolf's crazy green suit, but when I started to make my own opinions about music, George Michael's version of Somebody to Love hit me hard. It still does. Anyroad. [Here's some rehearsal footage that I've never seen before](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkoqIJyY4zY), which is why the internet is a beautiful thing.
