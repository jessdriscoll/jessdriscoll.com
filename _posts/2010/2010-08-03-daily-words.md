It's just past 6am, but I've actually been awake since just after 5am. I tried to lull myself back to sleep, but seeing as I went to sleep just after 11pm last night, I suppose my body's done. I was so tired, even though I didn't do anything yesterday. I didn't get the writing done I wanted done. I barely even read. I watched my soaps and I watched SHERLOCK, all of which were excellent, and I love them. But I wanted to write. I need to write.

I've been thinking about my attempts at romance writing. I have a blog to go with this, of course. I have a blog to go with everything, but it's only been in the last little while that I've finally made myself contain it all to factsarenothing. I don't know why but generalclassification was the last straw. This is all stuff I love. Every venture I attempt is something I have great love for (cycling, men's fashion, DIY, writing), so why do I keep islanding my interests off to separate blogs? No longer. I even renamed the etsy store to match. If I ever got back on Twitter, I'd rename that, too. I love the name, it's stuck for three years, I've loved it for three years. I don't think anything I've done on the internet has stuck this long. Rather, anything I've done that I've still loved this much after three years.

But for the romance writing, I want a pseudonym. I don't want to do this under my own name, and then try to get something else published with the same name. It might come out in the end, because I'm not ashamed of what I write. I'm just not sure how it would go over. (Sidenote: I write a lot using the "I verb" construction. Apparently that's a female thing.) I want to be able to write all types of things. If this is the way to do it, I don't mind. I kind of like having another name, another identity. But it does mean cultivating that identity. I'm not sure what I'm supposed to be writing about at the pseudonym blog. I really can't write about stories in progress. It's the fastest way to kill momentum and motivation. But can I write about the writing process? I need to try something. Maybe pick a day of the week, and write a quick update. Tuesday sounds good. It's today. It'll get me started. It'll keep up my resolution not to wait or think, just do. Get excited and make things. 

Get excited and write things, rather. I need to run some errands today, and might not get a chance to sit down for any extended time to write. The grandparents are coming back today. I didn't get nearly everything done I wanted done. But I made some great food. That's always a priority when I housesit.

The story I'm working on is at a weird moment. I think that's what's stopping me. Instead of writing, yesterday I reread a bunch of my old stories. In the moment, I was complaining, but I was still writing 500+ words every day for an entire month. In the end there, I was writing 900+. Now, that just seems crazy. But the thing was, I didn't wait. I came up with the idea on October 31st, I made the list on November 1st, I made the comm on November 2nd and just started writing. It lasted until July. That's amazing to me. I've never done anything like it before or since. Which is depressing to me. I want to do it again.

I don't know how to do it again. Does it need to be public? Does it need to be on LJ? Do I have to have a partner? These were the things that made it work the first time. We weren't always convinced people were actually reading. I can write just as well, maybe better, in Google Docs. I don't know.

This, of course, doesn't really solve the problem of needing content. I can't post stories in progress anyway. But maybe I can post tiny complete stories. Just thoughts. Maybe. Maybe write more about the thinking process, what I'm researching, what I'm reading. What I see or hear or read that leads to story. That age old question, where do you get your ideas?
