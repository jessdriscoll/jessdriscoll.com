It's getting down to the wire. I didn't do it this morning, because I wanted to get baking for the party, so now I have to do it now. Every day. Write 800 words. I should make it 850 soon. Maybe not today, because I'm not sure I can do it in the time. Although, the time only counts up to 750, so it doesn't really matter how long it takes me to get to 850. How long does it take me to get to 800? Just add another minute. That's about it, right. Because 750 takes 12 minutes. 750 is how many 50s? I don't think I can figure it out by writing. Or maybe I could just list them. So it's 50, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300, 350, 400, 450, 500, 550, 600, 650, 700, 750. And now I have to count them. It's fifteen. Which is actually closer to the average time. Which means that I'm right. 50 words takes about a minute to write. Just add a minute. That's it. That's crazy. That's a reason to write and the best response to an excuse not to. One minute equals 50 words. And you can do a lot with 50 words.
