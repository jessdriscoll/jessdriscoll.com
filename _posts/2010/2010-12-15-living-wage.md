>From an insider source: Today I learned that Wal-Mart could have created 40,000 domestic jobs in the clothing industry, however they decided to ship those jobs to China because they agreed to make each article of clothing for $1 less. Disgusting.

Every time a customer tries to tell me that we charge too much for "a two minute job" (Pro tip: unless I already have the right colour in the machine, no alteration is a two minute job) and that they can "buy a new pair of pants for that price," I want to remind them that our seamstresses make a living wage. The seamstresses who make that new pair of pants do not.
