We're almost there. Nano starts Sunday night. I almost feel ready. I know I can make the word count. I don't know what it's going to look like at the end, but that's a problem for December, not for now. For now, I just have to focus on characters and words. 

I have this plan. Starting Sunday night, I write one thousand words. Then I get up in the morning and write another thousand. Or at least 500. Then add another 500 throughout the day. Then, at night, before I go to bed, I write another thousand. That's at least three thousand every day. On my days off, I should be writing at least five thousand words. That's sounds pretty incredible, but it also sounds really doable. I do 750 words when I'm dead tired. And, you know what, every day is going to be easier. Because there'll be more to work with. I'll know the characters better. I'll be able to see the story taking shape. Right now, I'm writing around things. I'm trying to figure out my characters, but I don't have anything real to work with because it's not November yet. Pretty soon, I'll be able to get into the nitty gritty of it all. I can't wait for that moment, a week, two weeks in, when the story starts to come together. When there's enough there for callbacks and references and in-jokes. When a line comes out and sounds distinctly them. When a scene just keeps growing. That's when I'll know this is going to work. 

Tonight, I just don't have much to give. I really just want to start writing. Sure, I can keep rehashing the same character points over and over again. But I'm not going to learn the rest until I start writing the actual story. Even just writing some futurey-type stories hasn't worked. I need to know them before I write them. Because they're completely from scratch.
