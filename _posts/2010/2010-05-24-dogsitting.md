At Granny’s, looking after the dog for the weekend, which means I can get some stuff done. I can spread out, move back and forth between jobs, leave things, then come back to them. I did some baking, watched some Luke/Reid (holy crap, so good), cut some handkerchiefs, as well as all the other ideas running through my mind. I just feel so much more comfortable by myself. I can play music loud, I can read in bed, I can eat when I want. I don’t feel like myself. I need my own space.
