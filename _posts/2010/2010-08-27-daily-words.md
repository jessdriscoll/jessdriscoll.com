I think I can really quickly bang out my 750 words. I always mean to do it as soon as I wake up. Maybe brush my teeth and have breakfast first, but I really should do the 750 words before I check the internet. That way lies madness, and sometimes madness can be a creative well, but mostly it's just endless clicking looking for information to sate your mind. I already have a lot of information in my head. If I learn anything more, I might have to delete the fact that the Earth goes around the Sun. And that would be bad.

It's raining this morning. That weird rain where the sun's still out and shining. I'm certain this is the same weather that we had last night--huge, weird lightning flashes. The kind that fill up the entire sky like a light, but so fast. It started to rain a little bit, but not much. That's why the lightning was so interesting. It just seemed out of place. The day before had been hot and sunny. I almost wore my new argyle sweater, but changed my mind at the last minute, and I'm so glad I did. I would have baked.

I'm only working four hours today, which is so nice. I don't mind working a lot. It's been barely a day off for a week now. But if I'm going to work almost every day, working a short day is nice. I'll be off at 1:30, then have the rest of the day, and then the weekend, to myself. YAY! When I get home, I'll be hoping that AWZ updated. The reunion's so close, I can hardly believe it! Has it really been that long since they broke up? It almost doesn't feel like it. I'm not particularly looking forward to the wedding, but the Deniz and Roman part, so much.

Today, I want to get some writing in order. I need to take a good look at some deadlines and figure out what I can still do. I need to take a good look at my novel plan and see if it isn't worth just dropping everything else and focusing on that. Get 50k words written, see if I can get it published, and get my foot in the door that way. That was my plan with the short stories--get my foot in the door, but maybe the novel is the way.

Not that I don't love short stories, but what I actually love is something closer to a novel. I love vignettes novels. I don't know what you would call them, what we should call them, but I love something long that's written like it's something short. Like TV. Isn't that funny how one medium informs the other? Episodic novel, then, maybe? That's how I want to write. I want it to be big and sprawling, but made up of scenes, rather than chapters. I want to write it a bit like a long poem, but more prose-like.

If I'm not going to have much time these days--if I'm going to be working like this, I won't--I want to put my energy and focus where it can achieve the most. 500 words every day. I can do that during my commute or my lunch break. With that, I can get something done.
