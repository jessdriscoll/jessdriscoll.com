So, I have to write 750 words. It's a bit harder to do right now because my family could come in the room at any minute. At the library, I have the privacy screen. I love that thing. I know that the only people that can see what I'm doing are the people standing right behind me. And people standing right behind me aren't going to be right behind me for very long. Other than that, I have privacy.

You need privacy to write. You need to feel a freedom to just let your words out. You don't want to have to censor yourself or keep anything back. You just want to type. Or at least, I do. That's how I wish I could write every day. Just let the words come out through my fingers. It's a dream, but it must be a dream that every writer has.

I just finished reading a book called This Year You Write Your Novel. It's a short book. A basic concept. Write every day. That's the secret. There's not much more to it. He didn't really have anything more to say. Just write every day. Write at least an hour and a half, more if you can. Write at least 600 words, more if you can.

I can. I've proved that to myself. Now, I just need to write some words that are good and in the best order. I can write, or rather, I can type 750 words in 13 minutes. Isn't that amazing? I'm at 250 right now, and my family could be ready to leave for dinner at any moment. My dad could wander into the computer room and disrupt me, but that's OK because all I need is 6 more minutes to get to my daily 750 words. 800 isn't even another minute. It's just a matter of finishing up your thought. It's barely a paragraph. I have to keep writing.

There. He just did. My dad wandered in and distracted me, and I lost the plot. I wasn't at all sure where my sentence was going. Where my thought was going. What is the theme of today's 750 words? Just get to 750 before my mom says we have to go. There it is. I'm so close to 400 words. As soon as I hit 400 words, I'm going to start a new paragraph and it's going to be about little room.

Little room might have to be put on hold for a few days. Until I have the internet on my own computer again. I may have my own time right now, but I don't have that same freedom. I can't believe how hard it is to live on just one hour of internet a day. Oh my God, I wake up every morning, and I want to check my email. I don't even know if there's anything there, but I want to check it. I want to check Tumblr. I want to check my reader. It's not that it's killing me. I can live. I just can't write.

It's funny. It seems that my brain needs to be doing more than one thing at a time. I like to walk and read, ride and take photographs, watch TV and surf the internet (how much do I hate that we still don't have a better verb for the internet? as much as I hate the word blog), sew and watch movies. But the thing is that I can't write and listen to music. I can't write and watch TV. I can't write and surf the internet. I don't know what I need to be doing to keep my brain up to speed. 

OK. I'm so close. They're just about to leave and I need about a hundred more words. What are those words going to be? Can I make it? I know I can. I can type fast enough to make it, but can I make up enough shit to fill the space. Look how close I am. I need to make 750 words today, but I don't know what I'm supposed to do. Do I have any great ideas that I can ramble? I have some scenes in my head, but I'm having some trouble getting them out my head and onto the page. I've even tried doing this long hand and that seems to be working OK. That seems to be what I need to do while I'm not connected to the internet.
