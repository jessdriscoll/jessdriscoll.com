1. With both my harddrive and my iPod dead, I'm left reconstructing my entire post-mp3 music collection. [A Stroke Of Genie-us](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShPPbT3svAw) was my introduction to the mashup.

2. There's not one bad song on Sting's Ten Summoner's Tales.

3. Today, my zine was featured in [MayDae](https://www.etsy.com/shop/maydae)'s picks inspired by the film, The Brothers Bloom. Thank you!
