Remember when you first played Nintendo, when you first played a video game with both hands instead of one joystick? You probably played like I played, jumping the controller when Mario jumped, turning it left and right when you wanted your car to move, even if you were 9 and had never been behind a wheel. Your friends probably made fun of you, too. Especially if, like me, you’re a girl and they were boys.

I've been playing Pole Position: Remix for iOS. The graphics are the same, but now controller is also the screen, and when you want your car to move, you turn it left and right, just like you’re behind the wheel.

Those boys you used to play with can suck it, because this is what videogames were always supposed to be.
