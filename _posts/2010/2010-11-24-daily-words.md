I'm not going to cheat today. I am going to write 750 words for real. I just wish I could write 750 words of the novel. If I could write 750 words of the novel then I would be over 15k by the end of the night. I have to make that goal at least by the end of the month. If I can get 20k, I'll be amazed. And to think I was aiming for 60k. Maybe by the end of the year. Maybe. I'm not super confident about it. But I have to finish because I have to finish something. I'll never be published if I can't. This is crazy. I don't have anything to show for all the years I've been writing. Well, not enough, definitely. And not anything that's publishable. So I just have to keep writing.
