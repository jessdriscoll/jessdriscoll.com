Three stages, so far. Three different guys in the maglia rosa. Three different teams, even. Of the last five winners, only one is racing this year. Most of the Americans decided to stay home for the Tour of California. And there have been a few crashes. The one day races are fast and fun, but three weeks on the road builds the tension into something so much more interesting.
