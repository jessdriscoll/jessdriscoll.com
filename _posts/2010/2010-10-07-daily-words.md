This story is really coming together. I'm pretty happy with it so far. I have characters and they have names, and I've figured out the relationships, and there's conflict and obstacles to love, and I haven't quite decided what the ending will be, but I'll get there. Now that I've got most of the planning done, I just need to start writing. I read most of Hamlet today. A kind of prep. I'm not sure how much I'm going to use. My favourite scenes. I love the opening, with Horatio and the guards. The intro to Rosencrantz and Guildenstern. Hamlet's To be or not to be, which is followed by the Nunnery scene. The end. Most of the Horatio parts, really.
