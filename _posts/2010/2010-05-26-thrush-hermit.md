You probably know that I love Joel Plaskett. [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKUKKoqcUlY), which I must have seen on GOING COASTAL first, was how I discovered him. Clayton Park was Thrush Hermit’s last album, so I was a little late.

My best friend is 7 years older than me, and her husband sits halfway between the two of us, so a lot of our conversations devolve into throwing out pop culture references and analysing where we were in our lives for each one. Musically, and I thank my parents every day for this, I’m older than my actual years, but I still basically missed grunge. I discovered Nevermind after Kurt was dead and the rest of the world had moved on. 

If you were born between 1975 and 1985, and you’ve spent half as much time thinking about patterns in culture as I have, you might have noticed this: just as we reached the age when our taste should have been driving the mainstream, the age that drives the mainstream plunged. The record skipped, and nobody noticed but us.

I graduated high school in 1999, the Britney and Justin era in full force. I’m certain it’s why I always turn to Canadian music first, because I did then. We weren’t done with rock and roll yet.
