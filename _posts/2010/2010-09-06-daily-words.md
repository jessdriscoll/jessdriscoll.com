I don't have a lot of time and energy these days for a writing commitment, but I still want to write. It still makes me feel guilty every day that I don't. Because it is my great love. It's been too long for this all to have been a fluke. I am a writer, even moreso on the days I don't write. And I've been feeling horrible about it even more lately, with this new job, that hasn't really settled, and I'm not sure ever actually will. I think it's going to be like this. I wish they would hire just one more person. I think we need one more person sewing back there.

But this isn't about sewing. This is about writing. I want to be writing, and I am, but not as much as I like. Every day that I can get one good sentence in Simplenote is a good day. But I want more sentences. I want more paragraphs. Which is why my daily writing idea is a random thing. The first month is just ideas. Things I'm thinking about, scenes, moments. Then those get expanded. Add a couple hundred words a day. Say, 500 words. Just keep it to those increments. 500 words wasn't hard. It's not hard here, where I write 800 every morning, even when I have to get out of bed and get to work. It's just that there is so much I want to write that I can't decide.

But should I decide. Should I pick one story and work at it for 30 days? Focus, that's what I always say I need to work on, right?
