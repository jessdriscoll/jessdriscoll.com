So I'm out of August. I missed one day, and it's not because I didn't have the internet, it's because I turned off the daily reminders. Which is so stupid. I should have known better. The only reason I remember to do and check things is because I have my own computer set up to within an inch of its life. Things are exactly how I want them so nothing slips through the cracks.

But it's OK. I'm still just starting. And I have a pretty good reason. And I'm not going to give up on the rest of the month just because I missed a day. That's no reason to throw away the streak. It just starts all over again. But, as I've discovered so far, 750 words is easy. I can do it. I just have to remember it. Back on track towards that phoenix badge.

Rambling today should be about how I'm still having trouble writing. What's up with that? Without internet access, I've replaced the distraction with TV. When I get back, I think I'll unplug the TV. Turn my computer on and play some music. I don't write well with music, but I don't write at all with TV or internet. It's a start. I spent all day watching TV or watching the dog. She seems to be fine on her own. She's sleeping now.

She's a nocturnal dog. How weird is that? Two days now she's woken me up during the night. Not just once, but multiple times. It means that I have to sleep in more just to make up the deficit. I didn't get up for good today until ten minutes before 10, which is no good. That's back to where I was before. I kept the bedtime, fell asleep just after midnight last night, but it's the dog. It's the waking up in the middle of my night that screws me up. 

It's also the internet thing. Because Alles was zahlt usually doesn't update until after 2, I don't want to come up to the library for the internet until I'm sure there'll be an episode waiting for me. So I spend the first half of the day waiting, watching TV, like today. I haven't written a word yet. This doesn't count. This should count, but it's not real writing. It's rambling.

I can't do real writing here, because I've made my goal being undistracted. I want to keep up that streak at least, if I can't have the days. I can write 750 words in 13 minutes, and that's with going back and fixing errors. That's minor pauses to come up with a new sentence. I want to see if I can get that 13 minutes down lower. Can I get 750 words in less than 10 minutes? It would certainly be an advantage while I'm here and living on an hour of internet time a day. 15 minutes of it will be taken up here, typing, writing, rambling, while I could be over on YouTube watching my German soaps. If they ever update. 

Right now, on this screen, in this browser, I can't even see my word count. It's a little unnerving. I suppose I should just keep typing. It'll tell me when I'm done. Right? The worst is that I can see in the other tab that I have a new email. 

Maybe AWZ has updated. I can't see that just in the tab. I'll have to go over there and actually refresh the window. God, I hope there's something. Can't they send us into the weekend with a little something, a hint of what's to come. I'm so ready for Deniz and Roman to get back together. It's funny. After the Marc story, because of how it all went down, I really wasn't sure they could get back together, at least not this soon. But this proves what the showrunners and writers think of the relationship. They're one of the ones to stick now. As much as I hate the term, they're OTP. They're an Annette and Ingo or a Richard and Simone. Things, and people, may come between them, but they'll always get back together. They're meant to be, as cheesy as that sounds.

But that's what we love about soap operas, isn't it? OK. This feels like I should be done. And there it is.
