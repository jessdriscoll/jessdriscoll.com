Both The Bends and OK Computer came out when I was in high school, but The Bends hit me at just the right time. It's always been my favourite of all the Radiohead albums (except for the times I love the live album, I Might Be Wrong). 

At the same time, I've always been skeptical of the near-unanimous love of OK Computer. Maybe it's just been too long since I've really listened. I still don't like Karma Police very much, but I think I'd forgotten how good [Airbag](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfddfdpg1kY) is.
