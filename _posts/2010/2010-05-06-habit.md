It’ll take a few days. It’ll take a few weeks, probably, but I’m gonna make this a habit. I wrote today. The goal is just to put words on the page. Today, they weren’t a lot of words, but they were on the story due at the end of the month. It’s not gonna take too long to write it, so I’ll be able to focus on the big one, the 15k words due in July. That one’s gonna need some structure to get done. I can do this.

15k is gonna feel so good, and make a novel that much easier to write.

I ate too much, but did get out of the house, just up to Safeway to get my May bus pass. If it’s nice tomorrow, I should go somewhere and take photos.
