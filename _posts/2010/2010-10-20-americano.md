"Tu Vuo' Fa l'Americano" is the fluffy, fun part of THE TALENTED MR. RIPLEY, but what I remember about seeing it in the theatre, Christmas Day, 1999, is sitting there and thinking, Oh, Jude Law is going to be the next big movie star. Oh, Philip Seymour Hoffman is going to be the next big character actor. Oh, Cate Blanchett is going to be the next big actress. We knew Matt Damon and Gwyneth Paltrow already, but everyone who joined them on screen was better than the one who came before. I'm still waiting for Jack Davenport to become the next big leading man.
