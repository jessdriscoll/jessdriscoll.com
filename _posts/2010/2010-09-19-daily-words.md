Instead of devoting the first 20 minutes of my day to this venture, it's become the last. Not that that's particularly a bad thing thing. But what's happening is, instead of using these 800 words to expel bad words before writing good words, it's just become expelling. It's become a matter of getting words out and making the deadline and making the word count. It's getting harder. Not yet a chore, but that will change, I hope. It's just right now. 

I'm still trying to adapt to this new lifestyle. I'm still trying to find energy and time and space. I just want to lay here and read. I don't want to write. I want to want to write, but it's not yet turning itself into action. I have no direction. What is this story going to be at the end of it? Is it going to be a novel or just a collection of random bits about the same characters? Do other characters get to speak? Does this story have a moral at the end of it? Does it need one? I have to find answers to these questions. Not all of these questions, and some that aren't here, at the moment, that I haven't even thought of yet, but answers. I need answers. 

I don't need answers to write, thankfully. It can actually sometimes be better not to have too many answers before you start. That's my theory, at least. I have methods, when I think about it. I either want no information going in or I want all the information. That's my problem. I want to read all the books, see all the movies, know all the facts. Or I just want to write. Start with a list of prompts and a crazy idea, and just go. Both have worked for me, but neither have got me published. 

So what do I do? Something in between? Or keep going down one direction until it works. That's self-selecting, a bit, isn't it? If I just write, then get published, have I proved that that's the way to do it? Or have I just proved that that particular story didn't need a month of research? I don't know, and I can't know until I get something published, I think. 

My biggest problem is my big brain. There's too much room in there, which sounds like a bad thing, like I don't have enough ideas, but it's just the opposite. The problem is how much room I have to store ideas. They just keep piling up, collecting dust. They look shiny one moment, then dull the next. I have no control over anything it seems. I wonder if the magpie method would work. Have a number of projects on the burners, and just juggle them around, giving one a little stir, keeping another on a low flame, while frying up front over high with another. Dip in and out until something's done. I have a couple I'm working on. 

I think, sometimes, that all these stories are really just one story. The actual plot still eludes me. It always does. I never know how to structure my stories. Shakespeare had it easy. He just used the war. It's a natural progression, from preparation to battle to climax to recovery to end. I wish I had something that easy.
