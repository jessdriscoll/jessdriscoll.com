I need 1059 words for Nano today, but just 750 for 750. My 750 can be just rambley words where I complain about how I'm undisciplined and already getting behind on Nano. But my 1059 need to be real words with real meaning and real characters. So I'm going to do something very self-indulgent. I'm going to write a happy future scene, and it may not find a way into the final draft of the novel, but it'll count for now.
