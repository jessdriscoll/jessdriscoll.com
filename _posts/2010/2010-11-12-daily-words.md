Sitting on the couch and watching TV. I've added some words, but not enough to catch up. I want to get 15k this weekend. I want to get 30k words this month because I'm not really sure I can do 50 with my work schedule. But a thousand a day; that would be amazing. I don't need to win. For me, that's not the point. It's about having more words at the end of the month than I did at the beginning. Because I'm going to keep writing. It's not over at the end of the month. 15k by the 15th. That's the hard goal. I can do better than that, though. I'm doing pretty good keeping the plot going. It hasn't really started. 

What I'm having trouble with is immersing myself in the story. It has to be the only story I'm telling in my head. It kind of is. I'm not watching a lot of narrative media. Random shows when I think of it. I finished my spontaneous rewatch of Sports Night. It's weird. Like it's not a story in my head. 

I just need more words before the night is over.  I just need to keep typing. So close, but on the iPhone it still feels so far away. I can't just stop looking at the word count because I need to know when I cross 750 words. The site doesn't tell me on the iPhone. It's actually closer to midnight than I though, and I have my early shift tomorrow morning, and I just want to finish here so I can go to bed, but it means I didn't get nearly enough words written for my nano. I don't think I wrote enough to make even a measurable difference. Less than 100 would be my guess. Now I have less than 100 words to finish 750. Somehow, it feels like less. Practically, I know I didn't add many words to my novel today. But I still feel like I got some work done.
