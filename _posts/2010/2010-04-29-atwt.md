Understand, I only started watching this soap last July, when I caught up the entire Luke story in about a day. I only started watching any soap opera last July. (My mom's daytime indulgence when I was a kid was Perry Mason, in black and white.) [But is this not the best work you've seen on a soap ever?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBNbzvfo6R8) Eric Sheffer Stevens has invigorated, not only the actors, but, I swear, even the writing seems better. I'm not upset AS THE WORLD TURNS is ending in September because now I get to see what he does next.
