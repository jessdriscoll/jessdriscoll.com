Mom and Dad are home now. Spent the day working through my photos. The 2007 folder is daunting. I don’t know how those photos got corrupted, but turning them into gifs isn’t going to work. The quality is crap.

God, I love Stark Sands’s cover of Heartbeats.

I really really need a new computer. As soon as I get a job, I’m buying a MacBook.
