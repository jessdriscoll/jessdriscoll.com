>Fuck grad school. Don't go. A thousand real world rejections are better than any minor achievements in the glass box of academia. And don't think grad school is free of fucking disappointments and rejections. There aren't that many job opportunities even when you're finished. Just keep working. Work harder. Eventually you'll either find your niche or create it.

Sam's afraid I'll get sucked back into academia, but I learned that lesson (I taught HIM that lesson). I'm looking at the architecture program at Dalhousie. It's something I've always loved, it's a practical side of art, it's on the other side of the country. An English degree appeals because there's not one single job at the end of it; I can do most anything. But it also means there's not one single job at the end of it. After studying architecture, one can at least call themselves an architect.
