promulgate  
verb tr.:  
1. To make a law, rule, etc. known by public declaration.  
2. To make publicly known an idea, belief, etc.

How fitting that the very first word offered up for this new project is "promulgate"? To make publicly known an idea. This is what I'm hoping to do here. I don't know how often I'll publish, and I don't know how often I'll want to. I don't know if these little bits that I write are going to be any good. But the thing I want to do is write every day. To do that, and make it worth something more than just me complaining about writing (which is how I use 750 words), I need a source of prompts. 

I'm choosing this word-a-day website. They're random, they're anything, they can go anywhere my brain takes me. I was thinking about calling it Three Words, just picking three words and writing. I'm basing this on Ashley Ford's Five Things, as well as all those memes I don't do. But then I did one, just the other day. The meme asked for 10 books that stayed with you, and you know me, I can't just write out a list of 10 books. I had to write a little something to go with each one. 

So I figure I can write a little something to go with these words. Get some ideas out there. Get some words out there. Write more, write more often, write more of myself instead of hiding away and believing I don't have anything important to say. Well, maybe it's not that important. But I do have a lot to say, and I hope people want to read it. This is what promulgating is about. It's about spreading ideas. It's about putting yourself out there. This is what I am, this is what I do, this is how I know to make myself known. My words. Even if they're not the words I think I'm going to write, they are the words I have written. And they are for you to read.
