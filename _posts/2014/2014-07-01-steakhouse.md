Oh my god, The Review happened again! We wrote about steakhouses this month because Megan made an amazing steak at home. Probably one of the best things you can do for yourself is learn how to cook meat properly. Make it at home. It’s cheaper and better, and you don’t have to get all dressed up.

I wrote about fried chicken because I have a problem. We both accidentally wrote poems. I had fun looking through public domain images of cows.

This is The Review. Pay what you want. We thank you. Then go grill a steak. It’s summer.
