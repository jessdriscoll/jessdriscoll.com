a fortiori  
adverb: For an even stronger reason; even more so.

From the strong, literally, in Latin, a good phrase for the early days of this project. I'm trying to be stronger. Build stronger habits. Make stronger words. Find stronger emotions inside myself. This is how I'm going to do it: write. Keep writing. Always write. Somehow, I have to remind myself of this all the time. When I feel bad, write. When I feel happy, write. When I don't know how I feel, write, and you will discover. This is the only thing I know well. Literally. The only thing. The only thing I can do to a degree that one would call an expert. I could certainly do it for a living, if I could find enough people to pay me enough. It hasn't worked out that way yet. But I still do it. Every day. 

I'm writing here, and on 750words.com, and in my notebook, and on whatever project is currently going in Scrivener. I'm writing lots, don't worry. I don't know what's going to come of it yet, but that's okay. That's the beauty of writing. Sometimes you don't know what's going to come of it until years later. Literally. Whenever I look through my notebooks, I discover ideas that popped up years ago, that popped up again, and have popped recently, and now it's suddenly time to write about it. I can write about it now because it's an old idea. They're all old ideas. We only find new ways to write about them. The ideas we write today have been written about a hundred times before, in so many different languages, from so many different hands. There is nothing new, they say, and I think they're write. But there are new ways to say those old things because there are new people in the world. Literally. We are never alike, in shape or perspective or talent.
