[Sam](http://samwiebe.com) went and tagged me in this meme and described me as "someone who's really figured out the internet game." I don't feel that way at all! I'm always the one who breaks the meme chain. Are you a writer? Do you want to answer some questions about writing? Please do.

<b>What am I working on?</b>

Right now, I'm on the last edit before I publish AWAY GAME, which is the sequel to last fall's book, [HOME TEAM](http://www.dreamspinnerpress.com/store/product_info.php?products_id=4211). I'm publishing this one independently, which means I'm also working on writing a few more stories. I have a few more ideas in the percolating stage, but that's just how it always is.

<b>How does my work differ from others of its genre?</b>

I resisted publishing ebook romance, even though it was completely where my stories belonged, simply because the books I saw out there in the same genre were pretty terrible. The covers were awful, the editing was lax, the stories were generic. I spend a lot of time paying attention to the post-production stuff to make sure my books stand out in the crowded ebook world. 

I'm also a contemporary writer, which is a bit unusual on the internet. Sci-fi/fantasy is still where the majority of the ebook audience lives. I don't pretend to be a literary writer, but that's where my influences come from.

<b>How does my writing process work?</b>

I make notes and outlines in my notebook first, but it all gets dumped into a new Scrivener doc pretty quickly. From there, I split up the story into thousand word chunks and start writing. When I have a good outline, I write pretty much linear, but if some scene is stalling me, it's easy enough to write ahead and come back.

<b>Why do I write what I do?</b>

I wanted so badly to be the kind of writer who gets nominated for awards and goes on book tours and then Don McKellar makes a movie based on your book. But what I'm best at is shorter than the traditional publishing world wants. Luckily for me, I got into writing online in my late teens, and I got to watch the ebook world bloom to where it is today. 

I write romance because I love characters more than plot. (But I'm working on plot!) I write romance for everyone who doesn't see their own love story on the shelf at Chapters. I don't read traditional romance, so I needed some years before I was okay with being "a romance writer", but I love love stories.
