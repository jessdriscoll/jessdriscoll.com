Last week, I printed out AWAY GAME, the sequel to [HOME TEAM](http://www.dreamspinnerpress.com/store/product_info.php?products_id=4211) that I wrote last October. It's not as bad as I remember! It needs some work, and an ending, then I need to figure out how to make a book, but I want to get it out as soon as possible. As long as the teams left in the Playoffs continue to take every series to seven games, I just might have a new story for you before someone claims the Stanley Cup.
