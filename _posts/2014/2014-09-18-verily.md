perchance  
adverb: Perhaps; maybe.

Perchance, perhaps, maybe. I use these words a lot. I think that I shouldn't. That I should be more assertive in my writing, my ideas, my beliefs. But when I think about how I use them in fiction, there's a reason there. I love writing from one point of view. Especially because I wrote so short, there isn't time to jump back and forth between heads. And in a romance, I don't want to know what the other person thinks. 

There are a lot of maybes in a one point of view narrative. We wonder and hold and think and believe, but then we have to act. At some point, we have to get out of our heads and into the world and figure out this shit for ourselves. No one else is going to give us the answer. Finding the answers is part of the journey of life. Going out there and making the answers happen. Nothing else works in life. Living in your own head is not an option. Because your head lies to you. Depression lies. The only way you can find the truth is to ask around. Maybe they have seen something you didn't.
