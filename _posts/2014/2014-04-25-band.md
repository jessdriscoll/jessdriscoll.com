All my ideas for April’s zine have fallen apart or evolved beyond what I can accomplish in the next five days, in which I’m also trying to finish writing a novella (which has very nearly become a novel, by the word count definition). So I went back through the archives to find something old, still good, and ready for a digital upgrade. I found the essay about The Band I wrote in the days after Levon Helm’s death. That was two years ago this month.

You can’t make me choose my favourite, but Levon was the first I mourned. Richard was gone too soon, then Rick in the ‘90s, when I was still a kid. Levon was still around, still making music, when I became a fan of The Band. 

I’ll release the April zine in a few days, but until then, enjoy this, [a 1971 cover of Marvin Gaye’s “Don’t Do It”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11Y987Uf1wY), and one of the best examples of how Levon’s voice and drums worked together.
