I didn’t pick the view because it was beautiful, or a challenge to draw, or a popular stop for photos. I picked it because that’s where the bench was. So I sat, and with a sketchbook and a charcoal pencil, I drew what was in front of me. That’s it. Quick, sketchy lines, because it was so damn cold that day. I drew fast and put my gloves back on.
