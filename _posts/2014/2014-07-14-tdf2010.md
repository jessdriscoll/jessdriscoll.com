In 2010, I woke up way too early (Pacific Standard Time) to watch every stage of the Tour de France. I wrote something almost every day. This is a collection of the best. Contents include: Prologue, Stage 1, Sampler, Mountains, Sprints, Cav, Combatif, The Schlecks, Those Middle Stages, Bert, Champs-Élysées.

This is a zine I made about the 2010 Tour. July’s zine comes early because I actually wrote it four years ago. The Tour de France is on right now, so I put these short pieces together into a long zine. If you’ve ever wondered why I love this weirdo sport, this is a good place to start. Something to read on the Rest Day tomorrow.
