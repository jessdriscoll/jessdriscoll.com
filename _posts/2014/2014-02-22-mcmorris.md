[Interviewer: Mark McMorris. He's the hot one, right? He's so hot. That's my guy."](http://samsreinharts.tumblr.com/post/77437995898)

Mark McMorris: Thank you! I hope that was a girl.

Sigh. This is why we need to talk this stuff. Sports belongs to everyone, and the Olympics is supposed to be the place where we celebrate that.

My first memory of the Olympics is Mark Tewksbury winning gold in Barcelona in 1992. He wasn’t out then. That year, Mark won Canada’s first gold of the Games. This year, Mark McMorris won our first medal. And nothing has changed because Mark in ‘92 was afraid to be the gay swimmer and Mark in '14 is afraid of gay snowboard fans.

I love the Olympics because the best moments are small and human and true. I keep waiting for the best to use their moment to speak up instead of recoil.

It’s late where I am, and I’m writing this on my phone. I was scrolling Tumblr, and there was this, mixed up with the Glee, Teen Wolf, and One Direction gifs that fill my dashboard these days, and I couldn’t scroll past. Not when every single one of those things has this in common: teasing at the line between gay and straight, then running back to where they believe it’s safe.

The people in Sochi don’t get to run back to a safe space when the Olympics are over.

My thought aren’t complete tonight, and for that I apologise, but I wanted to speak up because, if Mark McMorris isn’t going to use his moment, the rest of us can.
