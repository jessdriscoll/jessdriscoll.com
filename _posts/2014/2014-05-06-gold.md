[John Stewart - Gold (1979)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-CJji921gM)

I heard this song Iâ€™d never heard before in a bar this weekend, and looking at Wikipedia now I know why it sounded so good: Stevie Nicks is singing and Lindsey Buckingham is playing guitar. (Not in this video, of course. This is Solid Gold, so I doubt even John Stewart is singing and playing.)
