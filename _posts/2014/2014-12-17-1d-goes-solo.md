Liam is Justin Timberlake. He's already picked the title: Painless. He hasn't told anyone yet. Because no one talks about going solo, but also because he knows Louis will laugh at him. 

Louis is Joey McIntyre. Acting, Broadway, plus one more try at singing, then reunion.

Harry is Stevie Nicks. He goes off and does his own thing. But he's ready to come back when they ask.

Niall is Dave Grohl. He collects vintage recording gear, which for NIALL is a Talkboy and a minidisc recorder

Zayn is David Byrne. Art and music and smart writing about the music biz.
