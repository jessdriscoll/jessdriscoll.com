While this essay started out as an elegy for Levon Helm, two years ago, it’s impossible to write about The Band without writing about them all. That’s just the kind of band they were. I love them a lot, and this is the kind of zine I make when I want everyone to love what I love. It’s part introduction, part analysis, part pointing to the good stuff. I hope it’s a gentle nudge to discovering The Band for yourself.
