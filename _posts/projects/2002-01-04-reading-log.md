A Moveable Feast by Ernest Hemingway

>Her hawk's eyes were clear and calm. I knew everything was all right and was going to turn out well in the end when she leaned forward and said to me, telling me her great secret, "Ernest, don't you think Al Jolson is greater then Jesus?"
Nobody thought anything of it at the time. It was only Zelda's secret that she shared with me, as a hawk might share something with a man. But hawks do not share. Scott did not write anything any more that was good until after he knew that she was insane. (186)

Barrel Fever by David Sedaris

>After that there was nothing left to say as nothing gets on my nerves more than someone repeating the same sentence twice.

Maybe (Maybe Not) by Robert Fulghum

>If you ever could attend a performance of the Minneapolis Chamber Symphony when it plays out in the small towns of rural Minnesota, you might notice an empty chair just to the right of the double bass player and just behind the violas.

Our Noise by Jeff Gomez

>There's only one store left, the Record Rack, the hairy chain in the mall that charges sixteen dollars for Pearl Jam's Ten and still keeps it in the New Releases bin even though it came out ages ago, as if some sailor is going to wander in after being out to sea for two years and be all, "Whoa! When did this come out?" and plunk down a twenty and not even wait for the change. (96)
