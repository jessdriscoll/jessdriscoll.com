A Moveable Feast by Ernest Hemingway

>Her hawk's eyes were clear and calm. I knew everything was all right and was going to turn out well in the end when she leaned forward and said to me, telling me her great secret, "Ernest, don't you think Al Jolson is greater then Jesus?"
Nobody thought anything of it at the time. It was only Zelda's secret that she shared with me, as a hawk might share something with a man. But hawks do not share. Scott did not write anything any more that was good until after he knew that she was insane. (186)

Four Blondes by Candace Bushnell

> He's sitting in the living room in a red-and-white-striped shirt, suspenders still looped over his shoulders, drinking a beer with his buddies from the network whose names I still can't be bothered to remember, when I come down the stairs, wearing a white brocade dress with grey mink trim and long grey gloves. My mother is married to a fishmonger. My father is gay and lives in Paris. I am going to the ballet. (166)

The Venetian's Wife by Nick Bantock

>I found myself asking if he'd consider selling me his Ganesha statue. Without realising it, I'd begun to want to own the chubby little elephant.

>He said, "No, I couldn't. It's a talisman. My girlfriend gave it to me the day we met, and even though it sounds sentimental and over-dramatic, I know she won't leave me as long as I look after our friend." (41)

Barrel Fever by David Sedaris

>After that there was nothing left to say as nothing gets on my nerves more than someone repeating the same sentence twice. I think it's something people have picked up from television, this emotional stutter. Rather than say something interesting once, they repeat a clichÃ© and hope for the same effect. (143)

Mockingbird Years by Emily Fox Gordon

>My ambition was not to change the world but to describe it. (155)

January 18, 2002  
Naked by David Sedaris

>"I love you," I said at the end of one of our late night phone calls.

>"I am going to pretend I didn't hear that," she said. (240)

February 05, 2002  
This Side of Paradise by F. Scott Fitzgerald

>"You used to be entertaining before you started to write," he continued. "Now you save any idea that you think would do to print." (215)

Obsessed, edited by Michael Lowenthal

>When I was a boy, the bathroom in our home had a spring-coil doorstop at the baseboard with a little rubber head, and I would pull it back and watch it vibrate from its fan of movement into a smaller and smaller object, until it was its ordinary, still, tiny self again. This is what sex looks like to me. (22)

Bright Lights, Big City by Jay McInerney

>A random sampling of the titles induces vertigo: As I Lay Dying, Under the Volcano, Anna Karenina, Being and Time, The Brothers Karamazov. You must have had an ambitious youth. Of course, many of these spines have never been cracked. You have been saving them up. (39)

The Object of My Affection by Stephen McCauley

>And New York seemed the likeliest place to go because I was convinced everybody ended up there at some point in their life anyway, and I figured I should get it out of the way while I still had the energy. (16)
