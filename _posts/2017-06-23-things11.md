1. My sleep schedule still needs work, but the one habit that's sticking is showering and getting dressed first thing after getting up. It's too easy to laze around all morning in my pyjamas, but if I'm dressed, I'm motivated to find something to do. Maybe even get out of the house.

2. When I do go out, I'm trying to pack food and not spend money. In my Christmas stocking one year, I received Rubbermaid Take Alongs: segmented plastic containers. They're perfect for lunch on the go. There's a big compartment and a small compartment, and you can put anything you want in them because they don't leak.

3. Another way I'm saving money is growing my own vegetables. My grandmother started the plants, and then I took over. I have big sunny windowsills, but the containers weren't thriving there. Now they live on my patio where it's more shady. The basil hasn't done well, the parsley didn't survive my landlord power-washing, but I still have chives, kale, and Swiss chard. (The tomatoes aren't ready yet.) I pick a few leaves when I come home from work, and then figure out what to make for dinner.

4. Container gardening is so much easier, and I've been thinking a lot about how my best work is tiny work. Short stories, blog posts, <a href="http://jessdriscoll.com/files/zine.pdf">zines made with a single sheet of paper</a>. Tiny art, tiny books, tiny yoga?
