from POLITICKING: How to Get Elected, Take Action, and Make an Impact in Your Community by William Rauch

DO  
- Accomplish something first: associate yourself with a popular community effort before  
- Show your teeth: stop something bad from happening  
- Get the constituency part: view your community as a set of interest groups  
- Ring doorbells: voters want to touch you. Make it easy for them  
- Be yourself: voters can spot a phoney mile away--and phonies don't get elected

DON'T  
- Talk too much: voters want to be heard  
- Do business with the city or county: avoid any conflicts of interest  
- Raise your campaign war chest from one source  
- Waffle: if you believe it, then believe it; if you haven't decided, then you haven't decided  
- Talk about personalities: voters want a candidate they think will get the job done
