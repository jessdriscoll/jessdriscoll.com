Half the reason I make pancakes every week is because it's an easy way to keep my sourdough starter active. My pancakes wouldn't be half as good without it. We discovered the recipe two Christmases ago, a buff-coloured mimeographed booklet my mom sent away for in the eighties. We started it January 01, 2010, in a Pyrex mixing bowl. It lives in an Imperial margarine tub now, in the back of my fridge. 

The recipe came from Robin Hood flour. That's why the starter is called [Sherwood](http://www.robinhood.ca/En/Recipes/Sherwood-Sourdough-Starter). 

By the way, here's the Robin Hood Flour Official Sherwood Pancake recipe:

1 1/4 cups flour  
2 tbsp sugar  
1 tbsp baking powder  
3/4 tsp salt  

1 egg  
1 1/4 cup milk  
1 cup Sherwood (sourdough starter)  
3 tbsp oil
