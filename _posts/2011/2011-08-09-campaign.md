1. I just need my word count today. I've been watching THE WEST WING campaign episodes that I managed to download today. It's research, don't kill me. I sent my query letter off to Query Shark today. I tweaked it just before hitting send, and I really love the first few pages that I included. It's a really good ending scene. And it's a better opening, too. 

Because, honestly, I rock the 1500 words. I just have to keep going. But I can convince you with 1500 words that I'm good. It's whether or not I'm good at 60k that we have to worry about. 

2. Who’s the Hey! artist in Halifax? Let’s hang out.
