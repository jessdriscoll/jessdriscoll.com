1. >It is, like, one football player.

Bingen Fernández, on the entire budget of a professional cycling team, quoted in The Pain Principle by Richard Poplak. For Team Garmin-Cervélo, that's "eleven Skoda station wagons, two eighteen-wheeler mobile mechanic shops, two tour buses, dozens of soigneurs (assistants) and mechanics, and hundreds of premium Cervélo cycling machines", as well as coaches, riders, food, and kit." 

Or you can have one football player. 

2. >Sir, no man but a blockhead ever wrote except for money.
