It's not actually very Canadian to celebrate Canada Day as an expat in another country, even in England, to whom we're still so connected. Except that Dan Mangan was in England just months after the Olympics in Vancouver. I don't know if the Canadians in [this crowd](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfXSPCPckKA) saw him play at the Olympics in Vancouver (I did), but it doesn't really matter because the wave of red that started here spread east across the country. It spread right across the Atlantic Ocean, apparently. 

(But tonight is a good night to be out on the streets of Vancouver.)
