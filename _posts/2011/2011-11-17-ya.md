>writing a 16-year-old isn't going to guarantee that your book is YA if the voice isn't a YA voice, just like including a romance in your book doesn't guarantee your book is a romance if you don't have a romance voice.

Jessica Faust, Bookends Literary Agency. I've been calling my novel a campaign romance, because that's the plot. But I definitely don't have the romance voice. That I don't know what to call how I write has made it hard to write sometimes. I like the names of things.
