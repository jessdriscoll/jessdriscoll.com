>"The Big Man" Clarence Clemons, an original member of Bruce Springsteen's E Street Band, passed away on June 18 after suffering a stroke on June 12, 2011. 
>It was literally "a dark and stormy night" when Clemons and Springsteen met. Clemons had just finished a gig in Asbury Park, NJ and walked over to the club where Bruce was performing, through a nor'easter. Clemons opened the door to the club, and it flew out of his hands, off the hinges and down the street. As Clemons described it he was "this black man" walking into "this white club" with thunder and lightening behind him. He walked up to Bruce and said, "I want to sit in with you." Bruce said, "Whatever you want to do."

2. >Silver Lake is inhabited by a wide variety of ethnic and socioeconomic groups, but it is best known as an eclectic gathering of hipsters and the creative class.

Oops, I just discovered that [Silver Lake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_Lake,_Los_Angeles) isn't one word. 

3. I've been experimenting with words on a page, like [concrete poetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concrete_poetry), but not poetry. I don’t know what it is, but if it’s something brand new, I want to call it concrete prose. All I do know is that I read more Calvin & Hobbes and Archie Double Digests than I read novels when I was a kid. Except it didn’t make me want to draw comics. It made me write shorter stories.
