>The novella has ambivalence built into its DNA. It's neither one thing nor the other and tends to make you think even as it lures you down blind alleys and serves up irresolute endings.

[Taylor Antrim, In Praise of Short](https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-novella-is-making-a-comeback)

>Now, artistically speaking, there's nothing at all wrong with the novella. Of course, there's nothing wrong with circus freaks either, except you rarely see them outside of the circus.

Stephen King, in the afterword to Different Seasons, but which should be called, In Defence of the Novella.
