>But sometimes when I was starting a new story and I could not get it going, I would sit in front of the fire and squeeze the peel of the little oranges into the edge of the flame and watch the sputter of blue that they made. I would stand and look over the roofs of Paris and think, 'Do not worry. You have always written before and you will write now. All you have to write is one true sentence. Write the truest sentence that you know.' 

Hemingway,Â A Moveable Feast
