Tonight is the night I'm going to pass 30k on my novel. Probably not before midnight, but it's still today until I go to sleep. All I need is 1350 words. That's one state. That's Nebraska, which I'm working on right now. I'm just trying to ease myself back into it, and I need a little warm-up. That's what these text files should really be called. Not rambling, which is more precisely a speaking trait, but a warm-up. This is stretching before you go on a run. Just a blank page and a cursor to help me get my fingers moving again. 

30k is a big deal, and it might even be worthy of a Tumblr post. 20k was big, but I had been there before. 30k is brand new. It's halfway. It's more than I knew I could write. It's worthy of celebration.
