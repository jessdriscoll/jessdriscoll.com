>if you do nothing but listen to other people, you become a human xerox machine; if you listen to no one but yourself, you become an island.

Merlin Mann 

I found myself in one of those moods today, where I write three pages, and then suddenly decide I don't know what I'm doing. But I do, and sometimes that reminder comes from my amazing friends, and sometimes it comes from the internet, and then I go back and write three more pages. It's just a thing that I do.
