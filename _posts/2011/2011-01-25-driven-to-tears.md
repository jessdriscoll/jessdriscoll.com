Honestly, this isn't a very good version of ["Driven to Tears"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbhL000TeHo), but the video has a 17th C French estate, 1980s fashion, and some dude with a fez who puts down his camera at about 2:30 to start dancing. Oh, and that might be Oates and his moustache in the background.
