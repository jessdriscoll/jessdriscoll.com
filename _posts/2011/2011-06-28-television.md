When I was a kid, I thought all television came from the United States. We didn't have cable, then, only five channels. One of them actually was from the United States: KVOS, out of Bellingham, Washington, about twenty minutes away, and across the border. CBC was government mandated to air Canadian content and did, with the exception of an afterschool block of The Simpsons and The Fresh Prince of Bel Air (I know, right?), as well as Coronation Street, which is still on the schedule, between news and hockey. All the other channels regularly aired the shows I knew were not Canadian: Gummi Bears, Saved by the Bell, Star Trek: The Next Generation. 

Because the shows were American, I assumed the commercials were, too. I know better now, yet I'm still surprised to discover Canada has things America does not. It's usually the other way around.
