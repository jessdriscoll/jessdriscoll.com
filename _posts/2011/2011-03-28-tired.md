i have nothing to say today. i am so tired, i don't even have the patience to read right now. and, honestly, i'm not finding anything worth writing right now. i keep finding the same stories over and over again. i need to clear the chrome cache and stop myself every time i want to check livejournals and tumblrs and delicious. there's good stuff out there, but it's hiding and i don't have patience. i don't like livejournal anymore.
