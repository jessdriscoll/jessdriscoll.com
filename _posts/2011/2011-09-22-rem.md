>To our Fans and Friends: As R.E.M., and as lifelong friends and co-conspirators, we have decided to call it a day as a band. We walk away with a great sense of gratitude, of finality, and of astonishment at all we have accomplished. To anyone who ever felt touched by our music, our deepest thanks for listening.

[R.E.M. Call It A Day](https://www.remhq.com/news_story.php?id=1446)

This is going to sound odd, because I was born in 1981 and came of age, musically, in the late 90s, but R.E.M. was the first band I called my own. (Unless you count New Kids on the Block, which I don't because that was about peer pressure, not music.) I once spent a whole afternoon with a pen and loose leaf paper, transcribing the words to "It's the end of the world as we know it (and I feel fine)" because that's the kind of thing you do when you're 12, right?
