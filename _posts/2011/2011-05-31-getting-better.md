[Everything beautiful about the world is right now.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rS7poe-eSXE)

There used to be an late night arts show on CBC called Zed. (Yes, we say Zed instead of Zee.) It was short films and animation and music and poetry. It was where I discovered Shane Koyczan. This, in fact, is the exact performance. 

UPDATE 2019-06-15: that exact performance is no longer online, but the studio version is.
