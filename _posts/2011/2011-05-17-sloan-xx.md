[Here are some Canadian celebrities (and Jason Schwartzman) talking about the first time they heard Sloan.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdWRbtjtqtQ)

I was 12 when Kurt Cobain killed himself. I got into grunge too late. By the time I discovered Nirvana, they, and their whole genre, were over, pushed aside for the middle-of-the-road rock that would take over late ‘90s radio. 

I think that’s how I discovered Canadian music. Our stations are required to play a certain percentage of “Canadian content.” In the sea of American boringness, Sloan, with multiple voices and twisty, linguisty lyrics, caught my ear. I can’t put a finger on my first time, but my best guess is the horns on Everything You’ve Done Wrong. 
Horns, on rock radio. You don’t miss that.
