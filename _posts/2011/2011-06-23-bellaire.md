1. I would love to attend the [Lilah Kemp Reading Series](https://lilahkempreading.blogspot.com) tonight, but I can't find it on Google Maps.

(Addendum: it's Belle Aire Street, not Bellaire.) 

2. >The magazine derives its name from a mistranslation of acronyms: when Harriet, Editor in chief, first moved to Halifax, she thought that the signs around the city requesting that citizens keep out of the park after dark, refrain from smoking in public places, resist the temptation to swim in the harbour, et cetera, came straight from the mouth of [Her Royal Majesty](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/157478644/her-royal-majesty-literary-arts-magazine). She later learned that it was not the Queen, but rather the Halifax Regional Municipality (HRM) that was concerned with garbage disposal and the distribution of parking tickets.
 
Me, too, Harriet. Me, too.
