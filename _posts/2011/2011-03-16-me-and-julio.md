[Sesame Street: Paul Simon Sings Me & Julio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1dlWmrRstc)

Holy crap, this kid is awesome. Paul is maybe more awesome for the way he just goes with it, lets her sing and clap and make up lyrics, while he just keeps playing the guitar and looking for a moment to jump in and sing the song Sesame Street hired him to sing. Truthfully, I think heâ€™d be happy to play backup for her all day.
