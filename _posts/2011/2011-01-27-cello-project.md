>Like it or not, there's no denying that Kanye West'sÂ My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy was one of the albums that will come to define 2010. As such, we can expect an onslaught of Yeezy tributes to dominate our web viewing in the next little while. The latest is an instrumental cover of ["All of the Lights," courtesy of the Portland Cello Project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYWCTlBUGZo).

They took my favourite Kanye song and covered it with my favourite instruments. This'll tide me over until he does My Beautiful Dark Twisted Orchestration.
