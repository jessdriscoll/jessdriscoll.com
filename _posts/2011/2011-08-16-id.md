I'm trying to get back on track with this novel. I'm recognizing that this is the exact same place where I abandoned my novel in November, and for the exact same reason. Because I start to think about the things that are wrong and the things that have to be changed. But that's not what a first draft is about. If this weekend taught me anything, it's that I can pump out a lot of words in a short time if I just focus on pumping out words. And, also, if I love love love the thing I'm writing. Because I wrote almost 8k in two days of pure id. It's probably not fit for consumption. But I love it, and I want to read it, and I'm still writing it. I'm still running scenes in my head during the day. I need to make my novel enticing to my id. I need to make it the thing I can't shut up about.
