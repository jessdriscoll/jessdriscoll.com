I sometimes wonder if I should time these rambling files, but it's really just a place for me to put some words down to get word count and also to think out loud about what I'm writing and what I want to be writing. Today, I'm exhausted, and I need to get some sleep, and today, I just need word count. I want to read, then sleep, then get up and have a big breakfast before work so that I can get through the day without almost passing out.
