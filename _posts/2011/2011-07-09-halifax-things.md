A List Of Halifax Things I'm Still Not Used To:

1. the number of people who smoke and how they’re allowed to smoke basically everywhere  
2. living two blocks from the ocean, but too far away from where you can actually go in the ocean if you don’t have a boat  
3. no mountains to orient myself  
4. the wind  
5. the wind tunnelling up through the narrow streets  
6. the narrow streets and how cars stop for you to cross wherever you want and wait for you to cross when you hesitate because you didn’t expect that  
7. lobster on every menu  
8. free outdoor wi-fi  
9. not having to tell people my area code when I tell them my phone number  
10. constant bagpipes
