I left the room as soon as the game was over. To be honest, I didn't watch a whole lot of the last period, either. I knew that just looking at Kesler's face would devastate me. I still haven't watched any interviews, but I thought [58 seconds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWXQQ_iNhTk) would be OK.The crowd kept chanting, Go Canucks Go. They kept waving their towels. It's going to take a little longer to get over this. 

My brother emailed me after the game. He's always been the bigger fan, but now he's writing the better lines. 

>We also decided that Linden would have scored last night. Even now after not playing for 3 years, he would have scored.
