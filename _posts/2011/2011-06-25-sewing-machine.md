1. >Ohhh the sewing machine, the sewing machine / A friend in need / If I didn't having my sewing machine / A wicked life I'd lead / But a bobbin a bobbin and peddle a peddle / And dream about romance / So by night I feel so weary that I never get out to dance

2. >I've always said that you know you're a poet when you type an emdash and you hit the delete button, and you type a colon and you hit the delete button, and you type an emdash and you hit the delete button, and you type a colon and you hit the delete button. If you can do that for about three hours straight trying to figure out which one is the best one, if you can do that for three hours and call that a good time then you're probably a poet.

Jericho Brown, from the foreword of [When I Grow Up I Want to Be a List of Further Possibilities by Chen Chen](https://www.chenchenwrites.com/possibilities)
