>An Imperfect Offering was set in Joanna, designed in 1930 by Eric Gill and released by the Monotype Corporation in 1937. Gill created the typeface for the firm of Hague & Gill (a printing company he founded in order to give his son-in-law an occupation.) Based on the classical typeface Granjon, and reminiscent of Gill’s earlier designs for the faces of Perpetua and Cockerel, Joanna is, as he described it, “a book face free from all fancy business.” It is named for one of Gill’s daughters.

A Note About The Type at the back of An Imperfect Offering by Dr. James Orbinski, and now I want to read an Eric Gill biography or maybe Gary Hustwit can make a documentary.
