One of my favourite things about writing dialogue is liaisons. C'mon and c'mere and wanna and lemme. It's the way we sound when we speak, and the way I want dialogue to sound in people's heads when they read my novel. C'mon, c'mon is also a rock and roll thing. I remembered [The Von Bondies song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFGo5cqcxP4) this morning. Then, listening to Transatlanticism and wondering if I could write a whole novel in the space of that song, the bridge came, and I had forgotten that, too. It's c'mon c'mon.
