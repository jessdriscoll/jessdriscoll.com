It turns out I did need my ramx last night for word count. I fell asleep listening to Build and Analyze, and it must have been just after 11pm. I get home about 1730. I have a shower. I eat after 1800. I go to the library for internet until 2100. Then, when I get home, I have tabs open that I want to watch or read or listen. 

It's not hard to find an hour. It's hard to find an hour that I have the brain and energy to write. I need to make that time. I need to make that time tonight, so instead of internet, I'm going to write. What do I need to do? I don't have anything I need to download. I can check my email on my phone. I can go a few days between checking Tumblr. If I can write 1k words every day, I can get to 60k words in 40 days. My goal all year, my low-level resolution, has been to finish a novel by the end of the year. I can absolutely do that. I can probably finish and do a few revisions of a novel by the end of the year. 

If I can write 2k today, I'll make up for slacking yesterday. But it always has to just be about writing something. I fell asleep less than 200 words away from 22k. I'm going to get there right now, this morning.
