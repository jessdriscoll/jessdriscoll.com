I’ve been here my whole life. Except for an aborted semester spent at the University of Victoria, I have always lived in the suburbs outside Vancouver. From this side of the river, every city looks like New York. And that’s where every kid wants to be.

Now I’m leaving in a month.

About a week ago, in a dark corner of the Vancouver Art Gallery, I watched a black and white documentary, part of 12 Manifestos for the City, and I wasn’t impressed. I realised I have to leave this city before I can write my book about this city.

But I can start collecting my stories now.

Aaron Sorkin says in the Studio 60 pilot that Vancouver doesn’t look like anything. Vancouver doesn’t even look like Vancouver, and I’ve always hated him a little for that. I think maybe he’s only seen Vancouver on film because it looks like Vancouver to me.
