1. >if you do nothing but listen to other people, you become a human xerox machine; if you listen to no one but yourself, you become an island.

Merlin Mann

I found myself in one of those moods today, where I write three pages, and then suddenly decide I don't know what I'm doing. But I do, and sometimes that reminder comes from my amazing friends, and sometimes it comes from the internet, and then I go back and write three more pages. It's just a thing that I do.

John-Angus has mentioned during concerts and in the online Trews diary, that the corner of Hollis and Morris is notorious for prostitution.

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Trews). This is now literally down the street from me.

3. >To eat well in England you should have breakfast three times a day.

Somerset Maugham
