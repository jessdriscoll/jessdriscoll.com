The weather today has been unbearably hot, and I started my period. That's not an excuse, but I didn't write what I wanted to write today. I want to get the novel over 18k words. I need to get my momentum back. I still have so many more states to go. I have so much more story to go. 

I watched CAPTAIN AMERICA this afternoon and decided that Neal McDonogh has to be in my book.
