>The long poem does not fare well in the textbook. Book-length poems are often not kept in print because they were published by literary presses rather than oil company diversifications. Here in Canada, in the late twentieth century, anyway, the major form of poetry is just about invisible. So why do I keep writing long poems? Well, Barrie did. Bob does. Nicole does. This is how we talk to each other. We are so lonely otherwise.
