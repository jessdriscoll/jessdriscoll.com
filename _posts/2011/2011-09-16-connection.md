A man and his young daughter stood beside me. He said, That’s a pretty window. She said, I wish we could take a picture together. I turned around and offered. The man pulled out his BlackBerry, launched the camera, and told me to hit the middle button. He crouched down with his daughter, arms around her, and they smiled. I hope I made them a good photograph.

This is a story about people and connection, and how art is in the middle of everything. Which is why I don’t feel bad about adding this postscript: That centre scrolly button thing on a BlackBerry is terrible.
