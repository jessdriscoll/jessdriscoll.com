[This is an essay about Vancouver, about hockey, and about the hardest trophy to win in professional sports.](http://jessdriscoll.com/blog/2011/06/16/the-cup) It's Canada Day, which seems just right to release my first book. It's about hockey. The Cup is the essay I wrote longhand during the third period of game seven of the Stanley Cup Finals and then posted here the next day. The piece different now--longer, better, but familiar. I couldn't be there to write on the walls of my broken city after the riots. I wrote this instead. 

I've made zines before, and pamphlets and street art and posted God knows how many words on the internet. With Cameron House Press, and a little help from Lulu, I'm trying something new. I always say I don't know where what I write belongs. I don't see my style and structure being published out there in the world. Except by the indie presses. So I started an indie press. I hope you read this, and enjoy it, and pass it along to those you think might do the same. I hope The Cup makes your Canada Day a little more Canadian, wherever you may be.
