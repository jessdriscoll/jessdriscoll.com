There's been something very ["I meant to do that"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KSor_f7xpcQ) about the Canucks goals during these Playoffs, but I really do believe Burrows meant to do that in that exact way. That's why they're going to win the Cup. PS Two hours ago, and I can still hear honking up and down the street.
