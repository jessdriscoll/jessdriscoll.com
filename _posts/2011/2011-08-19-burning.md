I'm tired. I'm exhausted. I came home and ate and watched PARIS IS BURNING and also the Pete Seeger doc again. I want to write something about folk music. I'm stalled on the novel at just under 15k words, but I'm pretty sure it's the new job. As soon as I feel settled, as soon as I'm sleeping enough, I'll get myself back on track. I have a new notebook so I can write at work. I get a nice long hour lunch break.
