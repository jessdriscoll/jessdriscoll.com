Caught up reading a pretty good romantic comedy, and completely forgot to write my own romantic comedy. I want to try to think of it a little more like that rather than as a romance novel. But it's probably not funny enough. I don't try to be funny. I never do. It just sometimes comes out that way. 

I know everything I want, but how can I write the damn thing? I haven't quite figured that out yet. But, exciting, I have more words than I've ever written before on a single project that I meant to be a single project.
