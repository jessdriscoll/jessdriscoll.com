1. The main photo on The Band's Wikipedia page right now is an amazing one and leads to [a whole set on Flickr of The Band in Hamburg in 1971.](https://www.flickr.com/photos/heiner1947/albums/72157689406514011)

2. The Decemberists were on QTV months ago, and I got [the new album](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_King_Is_Dead_(album)) then, but forgot completely to listen to it. It's really really good. Not just in the way I wish I could write music, but in the way I wish I could write novels, too.
