>Novelist time is reptile time; novelists tend to be ruminant and brooding, nursers of ancient grievances, second-guessers, Tuesday afternoon quarterbacks, retrospectators, endlessly, like slumping hitters, studying the film of their old whiffs. You find novelists going over and over the same ground in their novels--TNC was talking about Gatsby last week, Fitzgerald's a prime example--configuring and reconfiguring the same little set of preoccupations, haunted by missed opportunities.
