[Someone please teach the Canucks how to Dougie?](https://theprovince.com/sports/hockey/someone-please-teach-the-canucks-how-to-dougie)

This is the Canadianest post-game celebration ever. They won 6-0! We're just not used this. I get skeptical and nervous seeing the Canucks at the top of the league standings. That's not division or conference--the whole National Hockey League. It's weird. A year ago, Vancouver hosted the Olympics. Canada won more gold medals than any country ever. But, man, we're still not used to winning.
