[True North](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiSC6ufY4jk) is the song Willie Stratton played in the backyard on Belle Aire Terrace. I told him it could be on the radio, because that still means something in my head, though it’s been years I’ve had a radio station I’ve called my own. The internet is my radio station. It’s where I hear the new big thing, and if it’s where you hear it, too, take a few minutes, stop scrolling, pause iTunes, and watch this.
