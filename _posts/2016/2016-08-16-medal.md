"It was third time lucky, then, for the endlessly compelling contradiction that is Mark Cavendish."

<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2016/aug/16/mark-cavendish-olympic-medal-cycling-omnium-rio-2016">Owen Gibson, Mark Cavendish takes rightful Olympic podium place, but moodiness remains</a>

He finally got his Olympic medal, and I'm so happy. I wrote about how Cav missed out in London 2012. No athlete "deserves" a medal at the Olympics. That's what I love about the Olympics. It's about that day, that race, that moment. It doesn't matter if you're ranked #1, if you just won the world championship, if every commentator says you're going to win gold. People surprise us. If they didn't, we wouldn't keep watching. Cav didn't go off and sulk. He came back and tried again.
