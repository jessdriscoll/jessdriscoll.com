I didn't grow up with cable, so I didn't grow up with music videos. Being able to search and watch anything I want on YouTube is so amazing to me, ten years on. I have cable now, but the videos on Much Music aren't the videos I want to see. Except for two hours in the middle of the day called Retro Lunch. It's a playlist from the past, but my favourite part is that there's always a theme. Yesterday was alternative rock from the mid '90s. Last week, I caught a collection of soundtrack songs. Today, it's '70s soft rock. 

There's just one glaring thing all these video have in common: men. They're all male artists. That '90s playlist was everything I loved (and owned) in high school, but in two hours of songs, only two sung by women: You Oughta Know by Alanis Morissette and Violet by Hole. Today, Stevie Nicks is saving another retro dude lunch. At the beginning of this year, I made a resolution to read only women. Now I think I have to extend that to listening and watching, too.
