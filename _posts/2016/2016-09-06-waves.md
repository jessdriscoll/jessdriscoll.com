Because it's been grey and rainy, and I haven't made it to the beach like I had planned, I made art to bring the beach to me. I am not a painter, though I would like to be. At the moment, it's too expensive a medium for me to practice. I made a resolution to use the art supplies I have before I buy more (this is related to my resolution to read the books I own before I buy more). Because I started as a writer, I think of myself as a printer more than a painter, though I sometimes work with paint. I have a bottle of blue acrylic that I've never been sure how to use. But not being sure can make for great art. I've started making monoprints--paint swirled onto a ceramic tile I found in my dad's workshop. Printed, only once, like the waves of the ocean themselves--impermanent.
