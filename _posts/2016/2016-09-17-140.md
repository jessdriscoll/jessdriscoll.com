The only way to blog most days--my unofficial goal here--is to blog small. I noticed while writing yesterday's entry that it was just over 140 words. I noticed because Twitter gives you 140 characters, and my brain loves a pattern. I've been on Twitter ten years this December, except that I quietly quit a few weeks ago. I've tried quitting loudly before, but that's just ego. It's just wanting people to notice you, which is perfect because that's why I joined Twitter in the first place. This year, 2016, is also the twenty year anniversary of when I discovered the internet. I thought I would write a book about my life online, a celebration of writing, community, and collaboration. Instead, I just want to disconnect. I started this new blog here to remind myself what I loved about the Internet: freedom. Something beyond 140 characters.
