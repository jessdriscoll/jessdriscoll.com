I think most of us who remember computers in the '90s love playing solitaire. (You were either a solitaire person or a minesweeper person. I could never get the hang of the latter.) I love the way it lets me turn down my brain to a lower volume without muting it completely. Even with all the innovative games to be played on iOS, the one I always come back to is solitaire. But, of course, it's not just a game. It's also a distraction. I download the app; I delete it. It's not a bad habit, but it's not terribly useful either. One day, I might get a good essay out of the game, but other than that, it's just a thing I do when I'm bored, lazy, and when I don't want to think about real things. Recently, Google invented [a new way to play solitaire right in the browser](http://www.google.com/search?q=solitaire). It's much harder to delete the browser andÂ keep distraction away. It's amazing and terrible, this future we've created for ourselves.
