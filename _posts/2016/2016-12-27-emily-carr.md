"Emily perceived the wilderness in two contrasting ways. One grew our of a European fear of it; the other was rooted in her conception of the special relationship Indians had with it." (167)

"Oh, just let them open their eyes and look! It isn't pretty. It's only just magnificent, tremendous." (speech to the Women's Canadian Club, 1930)

"Emily liked 'to work &amp; create'; exhibition arrangements were dismissed with an 'ugh'." (203)

"You've got to meet success halfway. I wanted it to come all the way, so we never shook hands." (203)

Emily Carr: A Biography by Maria Tippett

One summer, a million years ago (2007), I decided to read everything William Carlos Williams wrote and everything written about him. The other week, I was browsing my local library and noticed how many books related to Emily Carr they have. So I've decided to read them all. I started with the definitive biography, which won Maria Tippett the Governor General's award in 1979, just as Emily had won it in 1941. It's a surprisingly quick read and the perfect overview before digging deeper. As I look back through my notebook now, I didn't write down as many quotes as I thought I might have. But I'm thinking a lot about Emily. I found myself nodding along. I found myself in this book more than I expected.
