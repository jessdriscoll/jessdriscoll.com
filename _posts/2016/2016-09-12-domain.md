Yoga is in the public domain. Over the last century, in particular, people have tried to patent, copyright, and brand the poses, the style, the tradition. But for centuries before that, it was just a thing people did. It didn't belong to anyone. It's a thing I've been doing for only two years, so I have no claim to anything. As I start my training to be a yoga teacher, I'm thinking a lot about authority and cultural appropriation. I don't feel that same lack of confidence when I teach English, because I grew up in that tradition. I sometimes feel like a phoney (thank you, Holden Caulfield) when I teach French because I speak the language, but I am not fluent. That's where I am with yoga right now. I worried I wasn't fit enough to be a yoga teacher, but it's just another language to learn. I'm good with languages.
