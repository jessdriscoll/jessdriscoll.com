There are a lot of things I think I should do. Many more I think I should do better. But I try. I want to have a daily meditation practice. I sit some days. I try for most days. What's helped a lot in building this habit--more than just wishing it true--is pairing the new habit with an old one. I'm not much of a morning person, so I sit at night, before I go to bed. After I set my alarm, put my phone down, take off my glasses, I sit cross-legged on my bed, close my eyes, and breathe. That's what meditation is. It doesn't have to be anything more than that. It's a conscious decision to be quiet and to be with yourself. That's why it's so hard. It's so hard to be with yourself when you're afraid of who you will find. But I try. And I like who I findÂ more every time I do.
