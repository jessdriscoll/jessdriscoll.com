Between Mays 2015 and 2016, I made 51 tiny books. I called the project Sunday Zine. The form was the same: an 8-page quarter size zine, print and digital. The deadline was the same: before I went to bed on Sundays. It was a challenge. It was also fun. It was a chance to write (and draw) and think about whatever fit into eight pages. I did a year, and then I stopped. And it's been hard to get started on something new ever since. 

That's one of the reasons I started this blog at the end of August. I just needed to start something with a form and deadline, something to prove to myself that I still could. I'veÂ been on the Internet for twenty years now. In that time, I've had tiny moments of success. The Sunday Zine was not one of them. It's hard to keep putting your work out into the world when the world isn't paying attention. I thought a lot this summer about giving up. Except I'm still here. And I'm thinking about starting a new project.
