A few days ago, I pulled a bag of dates out of my freezer. My grandmother brought them up from California, like she does every year when they travel to the desert for the winter. I put the dates in my slow cooker with a cup of water, then let them sit there to defrost and break down. It takes a while, but that’s why I like a slow cooker. The last time I did this, I added a cinnamon stick, but this time, I forgot. Once the dates are ready, I fish out the seeds. Then I mix in chickpea flour, whole oats and assorted grains, flaxseed, and salt. Sometimes I add coconut. Sometimes I add nuts, if I have them on hand. You can add what you like. It’s not what Quaker would call a granola bar, but that’s what I call it.
