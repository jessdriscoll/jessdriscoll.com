With a day off from teaching, my plan was to wake up early and go to the morning yoga class at the rec centre. That didn't happen, but I made it to the afternoon class. I like the city classes, not only because they're cheap, but because I get to experience a variety of teachers. It's possible to make a consistent practice with one teacher at one time, but also to try something different. Today's class was smaller than I'm used to, and the teacher made a point of introducing herself to me. That was something new. She seemed to know everyone else, and it made for a casual, fun class. Lots of jokes, especially as we bent ourselves into a deep frog pose. As I prepare to start my yoga teacher training this weekend, I appreciate even more the different teachers I've learned from, taking pieces from each of them to weave into my own practice.
