The last few days have been nice, sunny, but cold. I have a lot of free time and would like to go out and do something, but it's just too damn cold to sit on the beach. So I end up in the food court instead, writing. I've always wanted to be a part of a writing group. My favourite thing about doing NaNoWriMo is the write-ins, surrounded by people as weird as me. But it never lasts past the end of November. NaNo is, for most people, a fun challenge once a year. I wish I could do it every month. All my hobbies are lonely hobbies. I guess that's why I chose them. I wanted to do yoga teacher training because I wanted theÂ structure, accountability, and community of a group. I just wish I could find the same thing in the rest of my life. So I end up in the food court instead, writing, alone.
