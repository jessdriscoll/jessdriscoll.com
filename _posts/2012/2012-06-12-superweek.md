We're right in the middle of BC Superweek. Last weekend was the Tour de Delta; next weekend is the Tour de White Rock. Yesterday, I was at the UBC Grand Prix, a short, corner-intensive criterium circuit on the the University of BC campus. When the course is this short, and the riders are going this fast, getting a non-blurry photo feels like an achievement. These are my favourites from the day, where Svein Tuft went out early, and Dominik Roels stayed on his wheel to earn second at the line.
