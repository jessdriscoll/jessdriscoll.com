I use [this character generator](http://www.selfpublishingteam.com/chargen/ya/) a lot because if you ignore the ages, it's just a good source for names and personality traits. I needed names for the next thing I'm writing, a professional hockey player sent down to the minors, who discovers the local sports reporter is his ex-boyfriend. They broke up because he wouldn't come out of the closet. Here's what the generator gave me for the hockey player: Ethan, jock, responsible, leader, disciplined. His unique trait is that he's estranged from his family. Here's what the generator gave me for the reporter: Colton, book worm, honest, courageous, strong. His unique trait is that he has a big grudge. WHAT KIND OF BLACK MAGIC IS THIS?
