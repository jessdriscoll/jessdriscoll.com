The days get away from you. The nights are tired; the mornings too early. But maybe that's the time to get shit done. As soon as I wake up, instead of checking email, open a new text file and start writing. Don't stop writing. Already I've lost the habit. I missed the second day; how sad is that? But that's what happens when you have easy access to the internet. 

It's not really that I'm stuck. It's that I don't know how to make it better. I don't know where to write next to make it better. I have a lot of background, a lot of surface. But we're getting down to the wire, and that's where stories are made. The first 45k words weren't only practice, except that they kind of were. They were a ramp up to where I am now. Where I want to be soon. Something big has to happen next. The consequences need to come down.
