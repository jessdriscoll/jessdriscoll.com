The first issue of The General Review is up on Etsy! As it is the first, this one is a collection of previously posted bits--a few of our favourite places. We're hoping to make this a monthly thing, so we welcome any feedback, and we would love to hear topic suggestions for future issues. April will be about stone fruit, and summer is all about burgers.
