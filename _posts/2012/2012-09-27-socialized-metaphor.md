>I wish we had socialized metaphor.

Michael Chabon. I saw him speak last night, at St. Andrew's-Wesley United Church in Vancouver. The interviewer asked how he comes up with such good similes and mostly off-the-cuff, and Chabon made a joke about signing up for a service. "It's always private enterprise with you Americans,"¬ù the interviewer said, playing out the joke. "Canada is more cooperative." Canada has socialized metaphor.
