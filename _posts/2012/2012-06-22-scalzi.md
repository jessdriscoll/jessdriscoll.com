>I wrote a book that didn't suck.

[John Scalzi, on "How to Build a New York Times Bestseller (or Maybe Not)"](https://whatever.scalzi.com/2012/06/21/how-to-build-a-new-york-times-bestseller-or-maybe-not/)

I've never read Scalzi's fiction because it's just not my thing, but he is my absolute favourite writer who writes about the business of writing.
