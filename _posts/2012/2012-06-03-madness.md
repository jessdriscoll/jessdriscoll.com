1. Two female artists, a lifetime apart. 

>You have the madness of mud.

How friends and family described [Camille Claudel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camille_Claudel). La maladie de la boue made her make art--sculptures--but instead of making her famous, she was admitted to an institution by her brother and left there until she died. No one claimed the body. 

2. [Janice Wong](http://www.janicewongstudio.com/Art/index.php/Main/) makes two photographs of the Bard on the Beach tents, two years apart. I have a tiny print of the blue flag. I really want the red flags to match.
