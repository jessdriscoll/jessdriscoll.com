I bought [this print](https://78.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lwathjmuxl1qkm2iso1_500.jpg) in the art gallery gift shop (mine is quite a bit nicer than this photo, crisper), because I love woodcuts and also sailor's butts. [Go look at the rest of Robert Gibbings's work](https://www.robertgibbings.org); it's so good.
