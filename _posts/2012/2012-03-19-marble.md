>The famous "Blue Marble" photograph of the Earth taken from on board Apollo 17 was originally oriented with the south pole at the top, with the island of Madagascar visible just left of center, and the continent of Africa at its right. However, the image was turned upside-down to fit the traditional view.

I'm looking at a reversed map right now, on the wall in this hostel, and, yes, it's freaking me out, but that's OK! Science should freak us out every once and a while. That's how we know we're learning. Russia looks HUGE; China looks tiny. Brazil looks bigger, but that might just be because it's yellow. Greenland is suddenly very conspicuous, and Canada seems taller, stretched further into the Arctic Ocean than I remembered. The worst part is that I know this map still isn't correct.
