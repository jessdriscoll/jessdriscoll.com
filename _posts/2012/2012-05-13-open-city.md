For Open City, NSCAD has set up a mini-university on the waterfront. Come out and make art! 

But also, Side Door Takeout. Restaurants all over the city are offering deals on food that you can only buy takeout. Fid Resto is doing banh mi if you knock five times on their back door. Chives, the famous restaurant on Barrington, is doing $5 burgers. I walked up to Agricola Street where Brooklyn Warehouse had taken over the kitchen at Gus's Pub for one day only. The line was around the corner. The food was so good.
