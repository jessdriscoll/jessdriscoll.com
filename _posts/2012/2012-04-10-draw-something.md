Short story long: I really love some of the somethings I draw in Draw Something. But my iPhone on/off button stopped working a few months ago (after I used it to take photos in a particularly nasty rainstorm) so I can’t take screenshots anymore. Which means I can’t show you my favourite Draw Somethings. Which you should probably be happy about because, if it were easy, I would probably be insufferable. But I’ve started redrawing them in Brushes, and now it might be a thing.

Long story short: here’s a cool picture of The Beatles I drew.
