I still have a huge barrier to doing this every day. There's the point where I just have to sit down and do it. And with the internet, it's so easy to find something else to do. But I need to do this.

I went out this afternoon and took photos. I took a lot of photos, actually, nearly filled the card. And I was thinking as I was walking in the wind and the cold and falling on the ice, that I need to make myself do this. Part of the problem with living in Halifax is the weather. It's so easy to talk myself out of doing things because it's raining, it's windy, it's cold, it's snowing. But I need to get out and do things. I was thinking that I'd like to set Sundays aside to take photos. Each weekend, find a new area and just fill the card. Today, I walked past the cemetery on South Street (I should really find out what it's called), and I knew I wouldn't have space to come back and do it justice. I really wanted today to get all the way to the other side of the city, to the water at the end of South Street. Instead, I kind of wandered and ended up in the Point Pleasant area. Nice houses over there, and big ones, too. A lot of little cul-de-sacs, like Shaughnessey or Panorama Ridge. Expensive neighbourhood, but that makes sense because they're on the waterfront. 

I took so many photos today, I haven't had a chance to look at them. The idea of going through them all is so daunting. And I'm having a helluva time uploading photos to Squarespace. I don't know if it's my internet connection or something wrong on their end, but it's very annoying. It kills my motivation to work on putting my portfolio together. I don't know what kind of writing I want to post. I have to figure that out, too.

But, the idea of scheduling. Even if it's just an hour on the waterfront, taking a few hundred photos, I want to do that every Sunday. Also, I need to start scheduling time to write in my day planner and on my novel. It's getting sad how long I've let it sit there in the background without doing anything. I haven't completely lost the love, but I've definitely lost the plot. And it doesn't help that Query Shark hasn't done anything with the query I sent her in August. It feels like proof that the story just isn't very good.
