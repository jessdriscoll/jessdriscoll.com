This is a little bit of cheating because it's Sunday and I need to show the internet something. I can't tell them that I've made no progress on this thing all week. The Sunday word count is supposed to keep me honest. Instead, it makes me nervous when I'm not writing. But that's right, I suppose. I should feel nervous. I should feel guilty. Because I should be writing. I want to be writing. 

But I'm in a weird place with the book right now. I know it has to change, but I'm not sure how to change it, and that's what's stalling me. Maybe I should start doing more rambles like this. Start out complaining about writing, ranting about not writing, then eventually I'll start actually writing. Making the clackity noise, right?
