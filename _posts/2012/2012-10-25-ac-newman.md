A.C. Newman with Neko Case / The Hudson River Session - [Part 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WN7xDgCJWcE) and [Part 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCJs2gtyjsk) 

I wasn't the biggest fan of Carl Newman's first solo record. But that's the point of side projects. Everyone in The New Pornographers goes off to do their own thing, and then they make another New Pornos record. I'm not complaining. But Neko Case is singing on his third A.C. Newman record. I'm there. This is a 3-song session they recorded together for La Blogoth√®que. (Bonus points for Neko holding Carl's baby. This is a woman who likes animals more than humans and, on her live album, advocates for feeding unwanted children to the endangered tigers. It's adorable.)
