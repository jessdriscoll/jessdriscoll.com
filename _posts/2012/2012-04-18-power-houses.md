[Power Houses by John van der Woude](http://johnvanderwoude.com/art/power-houses-canadas-first-ministers/), is on the second floor wall of 1668 Barrington Street. It's so simple--photographs of the Prime Minister's house and the houses belonging to the Premiers (in 2006) of the 10 provinces and three territories. Yes, it's about power and perception. But it's also about the great big sprawling country that is Canada. If we can hold these extremes together, we can do a whole lot more.
