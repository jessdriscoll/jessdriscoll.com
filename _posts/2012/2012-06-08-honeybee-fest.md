I'll be at the Honeybee Festival again this year, July 21st and 22nd in Surrey, with zines and prints and more. I'll have my typewriter on the table, and I'll be taking requests.

It's tomorrow! I have a few surprise copies of my first fiction zine, not-yet-for-sale Cameron House Singles, all three editions of The General Review, as well as the single page teaser for July (maybe August now?), and new team colour covered editions of The Cup. I'm selling hand-stitched handkerchiefs and coloured felt merit badges and, yes, the finger puppets, my biggest seller, are back. I'm bringing colouring pages for the kids and my 1980s Brother typewriter--not for sale, but for typing.
