Pop music these days, I discover it through Glee or memes. [This song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA4iX5D9Z64) was from a meme. The song is catchy as fuck, and the video is adorable. I think her band has a secret game: whoever pulls the most focus from Taylor doesn't have to pay for beer that night. [The bearded bear dude is the winner ofÂ Mean, too.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYa1eI1hpDE)
