My current notebook is a [DeSerres](https://www.deserres.ca/en/) sketchbook. Love the colours, love the paper (especially with a Pilot Fineliner), but I've only been carrying this thing around two months, and the spine has come off. It goes in my bag; it comes out of my bag. It's not doing anything more strenuous than sitting in my lap or supporting my mug of tea. I bought a black one when they were on sale. The cover is different. Let's hope for the best.
