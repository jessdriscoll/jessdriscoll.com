If you love Raphael (who doesn't), then you will love this film: [A Tale of Two Raphaels](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWxsu7qOjo8). A documentary about Raphael's tapestries in the Vatican and Raphael's cartoons for the tapestries in England. Maybe it's because I'm a seamstress, too, but I loved seeing the women in the Vatican Tapestry Conservation Studio. They have library stacks filled with thread!
