I am not a portrait photographer. I'm not one of those people who travels and snaps shots of myself standing in front of things. I like to shoot the things by themselves. I like crisp corners of buildings set against flat blue skies. I like the points of roofs and lines of bricks. If a branch gets in the way, I crop it out. [But I like these trees.](https://www.katieholten.com) Pulled out of their context and arranged on a blank page, I love these drawings of trees.
