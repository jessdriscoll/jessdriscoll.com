[Abbott & Cordova, 7 August 1971](http://spacing.ca/vancouver/2012/10/23/stan-douglas-abbott-cordova-7-august-1971/), is meant to be seen at 30" by 50" and it is meant to be seen on the side of the new Woodward's Building. It's still art, it still means something, but it means something different when you're standing at Abbot & Cordova and looking up. 

I first discovered Stan Douglas from [Every Building on 100 West Hastings](https://www.phillips.com/detail/STAN-DOUGLAS/NY010617/269). I just now discovered [Every Building on 100 West Hastings (In Google Street View)](http://davidlook.net/portfolio/every-building-on-100-west-hastings/), a web installation by David Look. So many of my favourite things in one place.
