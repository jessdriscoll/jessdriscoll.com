blah blah blah. but the whole point is not to cheat. too often, that's what i did, just to get that x in that box. and what does it mean if you don't have the words to go with it? i want the words, not the x. that's the point. 

sometimes it feels like i just don't have it. sometimes it feels like i'm not a writer.
