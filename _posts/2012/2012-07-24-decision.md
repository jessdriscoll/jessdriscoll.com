I don't know if not finishing Human Events is good or bad or the worst decision ever, but I know I'm not a novelist. Even if I finish this book, even if I find an agent, even if I sell it, I can't write another one. I won't. I need to stop trying to be something I think will make me money and start being the thing that makes me happy.

Obviously, that thing is a person who writes ridiculous romances about ridiculous boys. And girls, too, sometimes.
