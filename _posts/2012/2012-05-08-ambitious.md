This is my plan. Write 20k before the end of June. Hopefully, before I leave for LA. Well, not 20k specifically, but finish the first draft of Human Events before I leave for LA. Get home and spend the rest of July getting things in order for the Nano novel. Finish the first draft in August. Spend September planning and getting things in order for another. Write the first draft of in October, maybe keep going and November, December. Rewrite Human Events in January. Start submitting in February. That sounds ambitious. But it doesn't sound impossible.
