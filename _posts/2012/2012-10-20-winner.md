>The winner of Paris-Roubaix earns $39,000 (€30,000) in prize money. A caddy (not a golfer, but a caddy) who works for someone that wins the PGA Championship gets $145,000 (€111,685).

This isn't a surprising statistic. I've heard many like it. Often they're used in support of cycling. A name sponsor spends so little of their total budget and revenue on cycling, yet more teams fall every season. The first thing that struck me about this statistic today is perspective. It pulls into focus the world the recently named riders doped their way into. The money, health, grief, and guilt wrought for this, just this.
