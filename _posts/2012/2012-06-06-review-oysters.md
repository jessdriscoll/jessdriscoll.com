Time for the third issue of The General Review already? Crazy! In the June issue of The Review, Megan writes about discovering oysters and, also, that she wouldn't fare well in a shucking contest. Jess drew a whole page of oysters to accompany the essay and, also, a page of Megan's favourite oyster condiments. We have a special double issue planned for July and a launch from Los Angeles(!) when North goes South.
