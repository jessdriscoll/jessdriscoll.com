After I realised how good it could be, I recorded the whole Willie Stratton show on my iPhone 4. It turned out HUGE (7Gb what?), but it turned out amazing. Are people making music videos and short films with their iPhones because they should totally be making music videos and short films with their iPhones. Really, I just wanted the music because you have to hear them live. They're also playing new songs, not on the album. This one, Black Soul Choir, is my favourite. (Oh, please ignore the sounds of my DSLR shutter. Also, Willie's guitar goes CRAZY out-of-tune at the end there.) 

UPDATE 2019-06-13: [Here's another 2012 version of this song that's still on YouTube.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTLnMEmQutM)
