>[advice to sink in slowly](http://advicetosinkinslowly.net/about) is an ongoing series of posters designed by graduates for the purpose of passing on advice and inspiration to first year students.

I've been trying to write a post for a couple of days, and these may only be posters, but, obviously, I'm of the generation who takes posters seriously because this worked.

>You have to leave your room to get there.

It's not hard to make art. It's hard to put art out into the world. It's harder even when you can't see for yourself where your art may be welcomed, let alone celebrated. If you've been following this blog since its beginning in 2007 or if you just clicked + because you liked that thing I did that time, I think you know me better than I think I know myself. Help me do this art thing for a living. Help me find my market. Help me find the websites, galleries, theatres, magazines, publishers, agents, dealers, editors, fans, shops, the markets that will love me and what I make. I put up my favourite works here, but what are yours? What do I need to do to make the world see me?
