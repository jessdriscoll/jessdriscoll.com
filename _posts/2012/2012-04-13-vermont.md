This is me, reading aloud the tiniest piece of the novel, six minutes and forty-four seconds near the end. Vermont comes near the end of the novel (which, actually, makes no sense, because there's no reason this senator needs to worry about winning Vermont), but this bit was among the first that I wrote. The first secret I taught every student I tutored was read your work out loud. It makes every sentence sound brand new. It makes a novel you've been writing for almost a year sound like something worth finishing.
