>I wasn't hellbent on cheating; I hated it, but I was ambitious, a trait we, as a society, generally admire. I had worked for more than half my life for one thing. But when you're ambitious in a world where rules aren't enforced, it's like fudging your income taxes in a world where the government doesn't audit. Think of what you would do if there were no Internal Revenue Service.

Jonathan Vaughters, [How to Get Doping Out of Sports](https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/12/opinion/sunday/how-to-get-doping-out-of-sports.html)

The timing of this admission isn't coincidence. Vaughters rode with Lance Armstrong in the '90s. He knows he'll be called to testify. Perhaps he's already been subpoenaed. We knew how Vaughters feels about doping. His team, Garmin, is the most openly and stridently anti-doping team in the peloton. He recruited the most famous reformed ex-doper, David Millar, for just that reason. (Also, dude can ride.) Now we know why Vaughters has taken on the cause. Now we know for sure. 

I hate that this is daily life for cycling fans. I hate that we're still talking about this. I hate that riders I love keep getting caught. But I love Vaughters for this article, and I love Millar for telling the media, after winning Stage 12 of this year's Tour, "Don't stop calling me an ex-doper."¬ù The fuck-ups will change this world.
