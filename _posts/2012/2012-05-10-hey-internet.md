Hey, internet. I love you. I've met some fantastic people here, some of whom I've kept around almost 10 years now. Maybe you don't know this, but for me, that's rare. People don't stick around in my life. 

I knew my best friend was my best friend when she disappeared from my life, and I didn't let her go. That would have been easy. I've done it a dozen times before. They get bored. I get bored. The context that threw us together stops being relevant. I let almost all of them go, and I regret it almost never.

I have a weird life. I'm 30 and single and marginally employed. This right here is the only thing I've ever wanted to do and the only thing I do really well. I could teach, but I don't have the degree. I could bake, but I don't have the certification. 

So it only makes sense that when I move back to Vancouver, I'm moving in with my best friend and her family, whom I love to death. I'm just lucky that they love me, too.

But this is all a sentimental lead-up to what I'm actually thinking: that I want to start an in real life writing group. I love the idea behind Jason Polan's Taco Bell Drawing Club. People just show up in a public place and draw, and it doesn't have to be together, but it can be together. 

I never liked the writing classes I took at university, even though it was my minor. I had some good teachers, and I wrote some good stories, but I never found the writers like me I was looking for. I never found my in real life writing group. This is especially funny to me because it was in one of those writing classes where (wait for it, because this is where my favourite writing trick happens) I found my best friend.
