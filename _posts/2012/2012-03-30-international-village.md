The Atlantic: Why Is This Huge Chinese Mall Empty?

There's a three-storey mall on the edge of Vancouver's Chinatown. They opened it when I was in high school. It's called International Village, but the demographic is clearly Asian. The third floor is an art house theatre. Half of the second floor is a food court. The rest of the space is almost always empty. It has been almost always empty as long as I can remember. I don't know what it means. I don't know if it says something about hubris. I only know that it sounds very familiar, that architecture looks very familiar, even on this side of the world.
