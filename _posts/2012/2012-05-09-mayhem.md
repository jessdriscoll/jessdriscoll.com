I had so much fun watching the Halifax Roller Derby's first bout, MAY-hem Massacre, this weekend. So I'm chucking out what Thoreau said about enterprises needing new clothes and, when I get back to Vancouver, I'm going to finally get those quad skates I've been asking for the last few Christmases and offer myself up as Raw Meat to the roller derby girls. Help me pick a derby name.
