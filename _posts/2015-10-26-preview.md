This is the November story! Despite the December 2nd release date. That’s just the way the Wednesdays fall, and I have a continuity to maintain.

This story started life as a very short one called SAFETY WEEK, but that title didn’t work so well on this cover. I embraced my cheesy romance writer self and slapped a pun over some orange leaves, and boy, does it feel so good.
