1. On a crowded bus, the dad, instead of finding his own seat, shoved into the two his wife and daughter had already taken. This is the second time something like this has happened and made me think, "John Sheppard would totally do that." Although, how he got Rodney on public transit, I do not know.

2. I have been waiting for that Street-coaches-Saracen scene since the beginning, and it was so good. I loved everyone on that field at that moment, all putting aside differences for the team. I still don't have any idea what Street told him to do, but that's what's awesome aboutÂ FNL. You don't have to know the plays to get the subtext.

3. Also, Mr. and Mrs. Coach hit my domestic kink so hard every time. I really kinda want to read stories about when Julie was little.
