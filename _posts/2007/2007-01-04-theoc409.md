Aw, man, they've cancelled The O.C. And it was just getting good again.

But then I watched tonight's episode. It's only fitting that after genuinely surprising me with the Ryan's dad reveal in the last one, Josh&co come back and telegraph every damn plotline. I didn't not see one of those coming, but I do have to give mad props for bringing the show full circle with another rich Cooper falling for another ex-con Atwood.

No props, though, for the continued segregation of Seth and Ryan storylines. It's got me rooting for Ryan/Taylor.
