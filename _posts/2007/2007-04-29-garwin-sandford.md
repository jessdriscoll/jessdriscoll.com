If anyone ever wanted the History of Filming American Television in Vancouver, take a scroll through [Garwin Sanford](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0762560/)'s filmography. The guy's been in everything, and his latest Supernatural role hasn't even made the list yet. At the top there's Stargate: Atlantis and The 4400 and Eureka, and I scroll down wondering, "Did he do Smallville?" (Yes) "Did he do a Cold Squad?" (Of course), "Highlander? Sliders?" (Yep. Yep.), "Wow, I wonder if he did a--" (Yes, he did a 21 Jump Street. He also did a MacGyver. And a Viper, which I never saw on TV, but did see them crash that car.)
