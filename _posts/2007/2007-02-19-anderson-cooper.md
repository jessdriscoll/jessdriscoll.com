1. I had this long, elaborate dream about Anderson Cooper last night, but the important part is, he took me to dinner with his friends, and the introductions went something like this:

Friend #1: Jon Stewart.
Me: I'm a big fan.
Friend #2: Stephen Colbert
Me: I watch you all the time.
Friend #3: Keith Olbermann
Me: We don't get your show in Canada.

Awkward.
