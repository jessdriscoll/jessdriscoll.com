If [My Musical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Musical) is an album, "Guy Love" is the single. But "Going to be OK" is the real stand out. It reminds me of 15 and seeing RENT the first time. It's as beautiful as "Everything comes down to poo" is silly. Nice to know we can always count on Scrubs for that.
