I discovered Twitter through [this guy](http://russelldavies.typepad.com/) who I discovered through kallipoe because it all comes back to Livejournal.

Inspired by Twitter, Russell Davies has created [dawdlr](http://dawdlr.tumblr.com/), and it's exactly the combination of old school and new school that I love.
