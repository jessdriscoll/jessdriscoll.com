Why aren't there more SG:A AUs about John being a pilot and doing piloty things? I mean, actual pilot things, not being the rich heir to an aeronautics company and doing fanon math things.

Which is to say my writing teacher just introduced me to William Langewiesche's essays and his father's books, and there needs to be a story called Stick and Rudder about John being a pilot and doing piloty things.
