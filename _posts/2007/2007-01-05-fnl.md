Friday Night Lights is so good it almost makes me want to say y'all. Almost.

I did my own illegally downloaded marathon over the holidays because you guys wouldn't shut up about it, and, dude, I'm sold. 

Here's what I wrote in my notebook after watching the pilot:

The reason I avoided Friday Night Lights for so long:

1. I really really don’t like football.

The reason I’m watching now:

1. This show is not about football.

Has there ever been a more sincere and earnest character on TV than Matt Saracen?
