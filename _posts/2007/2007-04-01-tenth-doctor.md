See, now, the problem with this season of Doctor Who is that, instead of watching for the Doctor, whose big fluffy hair and tight blue suits I absolutely love, I'm waiting for the Captain. It's really hard to sit back and enjoy Space Rhinos and Shakespeare when Torchwood is still on hiatus, and they're gonna drag it out as long as possible.

That said, I like the new girl.
