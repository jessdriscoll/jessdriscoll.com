I don't know, maybe it's too obvious, but my World Civilizations class makes me want to write a "the Team plays Risk" story. This is the one where Ronon keeps attacking and not always winning, until he's down to just one infantry piece, a stealthy army of men who invade McKay's territories from behind because Rodney won't take his fingers off the pieces until he's really really sure of his move, or until Sheppard yells at him, which he does a lot of, and, slowly but surely, while the boys are fighting, Teyla conquers the world.
