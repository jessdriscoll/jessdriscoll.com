I have to tell you, every time John Prine's "Sabu Visits the Twin Cities Alone" comes up on shuffle, which isn't that often since Sab only just gave it to me, I think I know it already, like I heard it at a restaurant, or in a movie, or pulled it out of the collective subconscious and forgot to write down the title the first time 'round. At least twice now, it's made me say, "Wait, where do I know this from?" I can't remember the last song I felt I knew so deeply so soon.
