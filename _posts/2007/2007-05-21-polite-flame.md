I just received the most polite flame, from a UBC Philosophy professor of all people, about a list I wrote and posted to my blog about a talk he gave. I was especially amused by his question: _I don't know what the point of this "list" is?_ (quotation marks his. Also, not actually a question.)

Dude, not you, nor that Ph.D behind your name, is going to stop me writing and posting lists that have no point.

I don't think he understands that's what the internet is all about.

(Also, he totally ruined my mood. I was writing a story about John Sheppard and flying lessons, man!)
