On Wikipedia last night, in between researching pilot certification regulations in the United States and figuring out when/if Studio 60 is ever coming back, I found Sam Seaborn again. There's an excerpt on that page from Bartlet's speech from "20 Hours in America", the one that Sam wrote in the car, and, people, I actually started to cry. Suddenly, I want post-"Tomorrow" stories.

This probably has a lot to do with Rob Lowe playing a damn convincing Republican on Brothers & Sisters.
