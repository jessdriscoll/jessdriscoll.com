I watched a young dad with his two kids -- one wrapped up in a stroller, and the other, a little boy with a mohawk -- and the dad was spotting his son while the kid climbed up to push the crosswalk button. It was one of those incredibly heartwarming scenes that make you proud to be human, but I was really thinking that, seriously, John Sheppard would give his son a mohawk and there's nothing Rodney can do about it.
