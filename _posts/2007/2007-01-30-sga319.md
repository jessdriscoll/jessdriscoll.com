Full of team-y goodness. Everyone had their roles to play -- there was just enough Elizabeth, and Teyla teasing Rodney (secret OTP!), and Ronon showing down John in the hallway is Play O' the Year. I could do without the heavy-handed exposition and flashbacks, but this is a pretty damn big hole they've got to dig themselves out of. I can't say it's totally working for me, but it is interesting. 

Besides: ninja lessons with Ronon, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Participaction">ParticipACTION (I feel your pain, Rodney), and a canonical Butch and Sundance reference.

That's really all I need.
