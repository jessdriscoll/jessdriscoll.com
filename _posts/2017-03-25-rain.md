It started to rain late yesterday. The kind of coming from all sides rain. Coming up from the ground rain. I can hear it pounding the roof kind of rain. Still, when I woke up at 3:30AM just now, Jack ran to the back door, scratching to go out. Cats are so weird. He won't drink water that isn't fresh or running out of the tap, so of course he wants to go out and play in the puddles.
