I love my new website. Since I started my new blog using GitHub Pages, I’ve wanted to move everything over there. This morning, waiting out the rain before I had to leave for a doctor appointment, I finally sat down at my desk and opened my laptop. Some work is still easier on the big screen. 

Now, my name dot com points here, to a new about page with a new photo of me behind my table at Euzine, taken by my zinefest buddy, [Kevin](https://kevinuehlein.wordpress.com). Over the next month, I’ll be adding static pages for standalone projects: a portfolio with images, my almost 20 year reading log, and a list of my favourite things made by other people. 

Tonight, laying here on my couch with a mug of tea, I picked a new colour for the links—a neon pink to contrast the sky blue. I love my new website. Just looking at it makes me happy.
