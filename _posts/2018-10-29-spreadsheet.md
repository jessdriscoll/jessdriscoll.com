Even though I write everything down, I don’t always write it in the same place. Today, I am trying to create a catalogue of everything I’ve written. I’m making a spreadsheet with titles, dates, media, genre, and I’m having some trouble finding all of that information. Because computer files update every time you edit them, you cannot rely on file dates alone. 

So I’m trawling through text files, spreadsheets, blog archives, and even tweets to track down completion and publication dates. For someone so obsessed with documentation and ephemera, you would think I’d be better at this. 

But I have this new spreadsheet (not nearly complete), so I can be better at this from now on.
