The sun has returned, I started a new round of pills, and I’m back to work after the weekend. I like when schedules line up like that. Symmetry is beautiful. 

The Tuesday puzzle in my daily NYT crossword calendar contains just 8 letters: AEGHIRST. Currently, I’m stuck in the bottom right corner because I just realised “Bit of mind reading, briefly?” can’t be ESP. 

I’m reading [the H.D. bio](https://www.nytimes.com/1984/01/04/books/books-of-the-times-151951.html) I bought at Powell’s in Portland. It’s a 400 page hardback, so not exactly portable. In Books, I have a few Imagist poetry anthologies from [Project Gutenberg](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/subject/10335). For a literary movement from the Edwardian era, there are a surprising number of female writers included. It’s spurred me on to start a book list for 2019’s reading project. 

Last night, after listening to Hozier’s new single with Mavis Staples, [“Nina Cried Power,”](https://youtu.be/j2YgDua2gpk) I watched the video for [“Take Me To Church.”](https://youtu.be/PVjiKRfKpPI) This morning, YouTube put the same video into my feed as a recommendation. Perhaps the internet isn’t as smart as we wish it was.
