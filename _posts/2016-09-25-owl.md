Looking back atÂ the list of recent posts on the WordPress dashboard, I see that all of them were written after 9pm. I'm a night owl, remember. I wouldn't say it's when I do my best work, but it's when I do most of my work. It's when my brain finally shuts up, and I remember I have work to do. At the end of a full weekend, my work tonight is to write this blog post. Most of my writing these days is stream of consciousness free writing, which means that I do a daily practice of setting a timer and writing, keeping my hand moving the entire time. The first lesson you learn is when you can't write, write about how you can't write. When you can't blog, write about how you can't blog. The only way through a block is through. It gets easier on the other side. It gets easier because you've done this before and you know the way.
