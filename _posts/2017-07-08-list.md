- My parents's pool is finally up for the summer. Even though I live just up the hill from the beach, I would always rather swim in a pool than the ocean. Fewer kids, fewer fish, fewer people flying drones overhead.

- I have always been the kind of person who inches their way into the way. I grew up swimming in lakes, and our lakes here in BC, they're not just cold; they're glacial. But my first time in the pool this season, I jumped straight in. It felt good. Not the water--that was cold. But just doing it felt good. No hesitation.

- After I swam, I read magazines and played cards. I've been trying to do more AFK lately. Playing solitaire with real cards on the table, instead of an app on my phone. It's nice not looking at the screen.

- Milos Raonic has been winning at Wimbledon, which makes me proud and nervous at the same time. It's always nice to see a CanadianÂ athlete succeed. But he's never been very good at closing out his matches. I'm always anxious when I watch him play, so I'm grateful for the wins.
