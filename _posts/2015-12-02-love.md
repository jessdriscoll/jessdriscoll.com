One last gasp of autumn before the snow falls, and we all have to write stories about Christmas. (Except December’s story is about New Year’s Eve, instead.) What do you think about when the leaves start turning? Me, I think about sweaters, warm mugs of tea, curling up under the covers with a book, and school supplies. So this story is about a kindergarten teacher, Mr. Rose, who has invited Officer Cowan to talk with his kids for Safety Week.

But this is a love story, so of course, it doesn’t end there.
