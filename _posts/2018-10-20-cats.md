My aunt--my dad’s younger sister, the same age as my mom--died this week. She was diagnosed with cancer earlier this year. It all happened too fast. 

She and my uncle were together since they were teenagers. They didn’t have children, but always had cats. I spent a lot of time catsitting while they travelled. The last one died last year. 

When the family gathered today, my other aunt told us they had to put their own cat down yesterday. It got sick this week, and then it was gone. 

She told the veterinarian, “I think my sister-in-law killed my cat.”

When Jenni knew she was going, she had to have a cat to take with her.
