Everybody loves Jens Voigt, right? While he’s still teasing us with his “final season”, I want to put together a fanzine to celebrate all the seasons, even the ones to come. Please submit essays, poems, portraits, comics, gifs, even your favourite quotes. Whatever you make, as long as I can copy-and-paste it into a .pdf.

A few details:  
- writing should be no more than 1000 words. Please submit as .doc, .rtf, or .txt.  
- submit visual art (drawings or photos) as .png, .gif, or .jpg.  
- include names and URLs as you would like to be credited.  
- artists retain all rights to their work.  

Please submit to everybodylovesjensvoigt@gmail.com before the end of this year’s Tour de France, July 27th 2014. The works will be collected in a .pdf and available for download. Any questions can be emailed.

Even if you don’t have something to submit, please reblog to pass the word along to someone else who loves Jens Voigt! He’s 42, and riding in the Tour of California right now. Get on the bandwagon before it’s too late.
