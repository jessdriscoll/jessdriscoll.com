My schedule is different than every other “creative” person will advise you: I write in the afternoon. People will tell you to get up early and write in the morning. Write before you do anything else so your mind is clear. Write before work because you’ll be tired later.

But I am not a morning person. Not even when I was in school or had a regular job or the early shift. Any time I thought I was adjusting to waking up before 7, I was wrong, and as soon as my schedule changed, I was back to sleep.

I need a ramp. I need to hear other voices in my head, not only my own. I need something to eat in the morning. I need to get my fingers moving with some words that don’t matter. Then I can write. Then I can do my work. Then I feel like my eyes are open, and my mind is clear, and I have something to say. I don’t know about you, but that doesn’t happen for me at 7 o'clock in the morning.
