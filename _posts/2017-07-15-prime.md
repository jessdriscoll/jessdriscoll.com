I spent most of today watching Prime Suspect. It's a British crime procedural, but it's really about sexism and the police. They recently made a prequel series set in 1973, when the main character, Jane Tennison, was just starting out as a police officer. As with Endeavor, the prequel series set in the 1960s about Inspector Morse, I watched the original series second.

I gave my 140 character review on Twitter: Watching Prime Suspect (1991) after the 2017 prequel (set in 1973). None of the men come off well in this series, no matter what year it is.
