Notes from the beach:

- "Mermaid hair. I remember we used to say the seaweed looks like mermaid hair."
- Saw a jellyfish that was probably dead.
- Do the fish stuck in tidal pools worry they'll never get back to the ocean?
- The couple taking photos of each other jumping at sunset are doing life right.
- A stoned woman asked, as I was walking up the very steep hill, if I was wearing heels. (I wasn't. But walking on the balls of your feet makes hills easier.)
