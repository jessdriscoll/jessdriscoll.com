It’s NaNoWriMo Eve, and I don’t know what I’m going to do. I know I’m not writing a novel, but I love the energy in November, everyone working on something and also cheering each other on towards the finish line. [Last year, I designed 30 solitaire games.](https://jessdriscoll.itch.io/solitaires) I just did zines in August; I want to try something new. 

I’ll definitely be blogging every day. But about what? My brain craves structure. I need the pressure of a deadline, but also the guidance of a prompt. 

I suppose I have until tomorrow night to decide.
