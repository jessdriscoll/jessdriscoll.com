In my push to finish this ever-expanding novella for April, I forgot to mark the anniversary of my first publication. April 10th, 2013, A GREAT ROUGH DIAMOND was released. Since then, [two more novellas, two more short stories](http://jamesondash.ca), and a lot of words which, hopefully, you'll be seeing soon. Thank you to everyone who has bought, read, rated, reviewed, or passed along a recommendation. It's still weird for me to think of my books sorted next to so many famous names in your ereaders, but I'm going to keep writing, and maybe a few anniversaries from now, I'll be more used to it. I hope you'll still be reading.
