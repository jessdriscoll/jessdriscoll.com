My homework isn't just to build a daily practice, but to do that daily practice while teaching out loud, even if there's no one there to listen but me. It's a smart thing. This isn't just one assignment I'm procrastinating, but two. I might be a slacker, but I get my work done eventually. I just need to waste some time first. You can't do that with sadhana. Sadhana means daily practice. You can't do seven practises on one day and call it done. 

Adding the teaching to the yoga makes it comfortable, familiar, a thing I know how to do. Tonight, I started just by talking, explaining the om chant, describing the warm-ups and why they're important, and by the time I was teaching the first movement, I found that my feet were moving, like I couldn't help myself. I wanted to move. I hope I want to move tomorrow, too.
