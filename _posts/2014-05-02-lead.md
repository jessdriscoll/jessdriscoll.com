[THIS ZINE SHOULD BE READ OUT LOUD!](https://jessdriscoll.itch.io/out-loud) is illustrated with screencaps from a 1971 video on YouTube. This particular shot is the first you see of The Band. They’re not tuning their guitars. They’ve already started playing, but Rick Danko is looking down, and Robbie Robertson has his back to the crowd. Garth Hudson and Richard Manuel are behind their keyboards and off-screen. Levon Helm is obscured by Robbie and the drum set.

If you walked into this scene, you’d probably be confused as to who was going to sing. It’s the question I answer in this short essay about The Band, written in the days following Levon’s 2012 death.

The answer is “kind of all of them”.
