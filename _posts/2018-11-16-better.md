If my brain is really better, there’s no better way to test it than trying to read a book. When I was a kid, I read all the time. But in university, I could barely get through short stories. I would have periods when I read a lot, then long months when I never picked up a book. (Reading the Internet is a different muscle.)

In the past week, I’ve finished three books—more than 500 pages. I haven’t felt the same need to check the Internet. I’m almost ready to sit down and write something longer than a zine. 

It’s only a week, but I feel more capable than I have in a long time. I feel big changes happening. I feel like next week might be even better.
