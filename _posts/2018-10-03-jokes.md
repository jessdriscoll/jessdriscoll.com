8yo: Knock, knock. 
Me: Who’s there?
8yo: Cow.

I explained he had the joke wrong, but he didn’t care. It was still funny to him, and it made the other kids in the class laugh. When you’re 8, that’s all you want. That feels like power. Kid jokes are surreal art. They don’t have to be funny to be successful. 

6yo: Knock, knock. 
Me: Who’s there?
6yo: Horse. 
Me: Horse who?
