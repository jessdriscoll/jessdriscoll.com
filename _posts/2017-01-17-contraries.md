"Don't worry, paint steadily, day by day, just to the level you know. Next day you'll creep on a little higher." (137)

Truly, I had more quotes from Opposite Contraries, but I just want to post this one and leave it there. Emily Carr thought a lot about the artist process, as I'm sure every artist does. When things aren't working, we tell ourselves stories to explain why. "Keep trying" is the universal story.
