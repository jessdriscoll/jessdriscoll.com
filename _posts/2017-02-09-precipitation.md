Today is a survey course in precipitation. It started late last night when the snow storm turned to freezing rain. When I left the house this morning, it was a fine mist, the kind that doesn't feel like an umbrella is needed but which soaks you anyway.

Now I'm sat at the window in Starbucks, and the puddles are rippling. This is what I consider classic Lower Mainland rain, falling straight down, getting everything wet. Take your umbrella.

Because I live so close to the water and at the top of a steep hill, we also get wind funnelled up through the streets. The rain comes at you from all directions, and umbrellas are useless. I've broken more than one fighting against it.

You can't fight the rain. You have to learn to love it.
