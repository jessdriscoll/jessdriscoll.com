Tonight was Art Space, the drop-in workshop I host at the public library. I brought my new button maker Megan sent me, which proved to be the popular activity. 

A young girl drew a panda for her stuffed panda, who got to wear the button home. 

There’s something tangible about a button, more than a flat piece of art. It feels like you made a thing, not just that you drew a picture. It’s art and craft put together, beautiful and useful.
