Because I was going to be downtown to meet some friends, I went a little early so I could visit Emily Carr at the Vancouver Art Gallery. That's the benefit of being a member--sometimes I go to the gallery to see just one floor, even one painting. They're in a transition period right now, so 2/4 floors was all there was to see on Saturday.

The VAG holds the largest collection of Carr's work. The fourth floor is usually hers. Until December, it's <a href="https://www.vanartgallery.bc.ca/the_exhibitions/exhibit_carr_intotheforest.html">an exhibit of her forest paintings</a>, my favourite paintings. I haven't seen <a href="https://www.vanartgallery.bc.ca/the_exhibitions/exhibit_scorned.html">Scorned/Beloved</a> on a wall in years. That tree trunk up above is an early painting, as Emily was putting aside her totem pole project to explore the BC wilderness. That tree trunk below is a photograph by Karin Bubaš, a Vancouver artist in the second floor exhibit, <a href="https://www.vanartgallery.bc.ca/the_exhibitions/exhibit_picturesfromhere.html">Pictures from Here</a>.

I only did a quick walk through the second floor (I'll be back), but Bubaš's photos struck me as I had just come out of Emily's forest. It's the same forest. They're the same trees. Bubaš placed women in all of her photographs, faces obscured, like my own reflection in the selfie I had just taken with an Emily Carr.

We're all making the same art, but in different ways.
