Sundays have worked for me before. I don't love a deadline, but I do love creative limits. Making yourself do a thing within the lines. When I made a zine a week, my line was a single sheet of 8.5 x 11 paper, folded into quarters, to make a tiny 8-page book. All I had to do was fill those pages.

I've been looking for more podcasts by women, and recently started listening through the archives of <a href="https://www.relay.fm/ltoe/">Less Than Or Equal</a>. The episode with <a href="https://www.relay.fm/ltoe/5">Adriel Wallick</a>, a game developer, reminded me that I had downloaded <a href="https://twinery.org">Twine</a> ages ago to experiment with interactive fiction. But her <a href="http://trainjam.com">Train Jam</a> project really interested me.

A game jam is a group of people making a game with a time limit and a theme. We used to do this kind of thing all the time in my early days on the internet, except we were writing stories with a time limit and a theme. Games are just a different kind of story. The first jam that jumped out at me <a href="https://itch.io/jams">when I browsed itch.io</a> was the Emojiam, and I was hooked.

So even though I just posted a game last Sunday, and even though today is Wednesday, I had to post something for Emojiam. <a href="https://itch.io/jam/emojiam/rate/153055">Long walk at sunrise</a> is board game you can print on a single sheet of 8.5 x 11 paper. It's also a love story, in case you didn't know who I am. Go download it, print it, cut it up, play it, and let me know what you think.
