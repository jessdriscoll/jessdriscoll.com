Every night I tell myself, I'm going to go to sleep early, and I'm going to get up early. Some nights that happens, but most mornings, it does not. It doesn't seem to matter what time I went to sleep, or how many alarms I set, I will always find a reason to stay in bed just five minutes longer.

The good thing is every night is another chance, and every morning is a new day.
