Emily wrote a lot of letters. She created her own notation language. She broke friendships if people didn't write back in the time she expected.

- N.N.T.A. = not necessary to answer
- R.A.L. = read at leisure
- Red Hot Special = read and respond immediately
- Weekenders = enjoy overÂ time
- Special Deliveries = important
