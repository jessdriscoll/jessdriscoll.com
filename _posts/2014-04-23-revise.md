I want to do one revision where I only focus on expanding the sex scenes. I am definitely a romance writer more than an erotica writer. Even my short stories for anthologies have to have story and backstory and character moments more than orgasms. But I know I can make the sex scenes I do write better. I put a lot of character into the sex scenes. Now I have to go back to them and add more senses. That’s usually where I need the help.

Or where my writing needs the help. I need to remember to add more than just what the characters are doing, but what do they see, smell, touch, hear, and even taste. I should do a read through with every sense in mind.

I don’t write stories that are mostly sex. I write romance where the romance doesn’t fade to black. It’s not about writing porn; it’s about writing everything.
