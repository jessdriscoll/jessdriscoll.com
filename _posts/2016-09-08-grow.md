It's rarely possible to leave my grandma's house empty-handed. Combine that with my grandpa's endless curiosity with gadgets, and you understand how I came home a few monthsÂ ago with a seed sprouter. It's four levels of square plastic. At the bottom, a solid container to catch the water. There are two deep dishes with slotted bottoms, as well as a shallow slotted lid. That gives you three levels to scatter and grow seeds. I grew up with bagged lunches, mostly sandwiches, mostly peanut butter. But occasionally my mom would buy alfalfa sprouts, and I loved them. It's taken me this long to discover how easy they are to make at home. But the best reason to grow your own sprouts at home is how fast they grow. I started some on Sunday. They'll be ready for salad this weekend. You can literally watch them grow.
