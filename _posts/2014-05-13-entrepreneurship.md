[The Mysterious Death of Entrepreneurship in America by Derek Thompson](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2014/05/entrepreneurship-in-america-is-dying-wait-what-does-that-actually-mean/362097/)

I remember the first time I checked out books about entrepreneurship at the library and discovered itâ€™s not about building a small business for yourself, but about selling that business and moving onto the next thing, and that just made me sad.
