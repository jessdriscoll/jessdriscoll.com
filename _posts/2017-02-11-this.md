This and That by Emily Carr

“All young life is poetry, frightfully serious poetry.” (5)

“Snow, snow, what are you? You came from the sky, why aren’t you blue?” (39)

Father: “Small, you got your love of trees from me.” (84)

Gerhard: “The roundness of the world is true! and the ends meet.” 
“We were People and the world was round. There were no seams in her. She was all of a piece.” (166)

“It always seemed to me nothing much could happen to one who was singing.” (169)
