Going through the endless stacks of paper in my house today, and I came across some New Year's worksheets I filled out.

“It’s December 31, 2020. You’re reflecting on the year, and see clearly that you’re living closer to your values than ever. What’s different? What do you have more of? Less of?”

My answers: More money (check), more freedom (weird half check?), more direction (shrug), more creation (ok), less work (YUP), less stress (NOPE), less worry (EYE ROLL), less depression (LOL)
