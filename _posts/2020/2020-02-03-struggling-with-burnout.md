I’m still struggling with burnout--both admitting it’s true and recovering. But I did my two January goals: I completed and passed my food handling exam and I submitted my farmers market application. This is my one big goal for the year, and the hard part is doing only this one goal. Not writing a new book, not making a reading plan, not looking for a new job.

But February also includes my next road test to get my driver’s license. So I’m focusing on that for now, and just getting to the next day.
