I made 3 resolutions at the beginning of September: write at least 4 newsletters, make a sea salt zine, and get dressed first thing in the morning. I wrote newsletter #4 on the 29th about how I completed all 3 goals!

My morning routine goal will continue into October, because I honestly only ~completed a highly-revised version in September. Right now, it’s just past noon, and I’m still in pjs (today is a no-work day). And I’m only making one other resolution: make some decisions about how to continue my homemade business without the farmers market (which ends this month). At this moment, I think it’ll be a lot more dry goods which are easy to sell through the mail, plus a lot more zines and written materials. I’ll still do baking in the future, but more in a pop-up sense than a scheduled market.
