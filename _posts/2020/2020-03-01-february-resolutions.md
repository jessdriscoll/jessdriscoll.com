My February resolution was to do my drivers test and focus on the farmers market, and even though I failed the test (again, ugh), I did it, and I felt good about it.

In January, I submitted an application for the farmers market, and this month, I was accepted! So the next two months are all about prepping for the first Sunday, May 3, when I’ll be selling my sea salt, sourdough starter, sausage made by my brother, related zines, and buttons! (and bread, of course!) (edited) 

I am very excited and nervous. [Here’s a sneak peek at the store as it is right now](https://www.alldaybreakfast.org).

And even though I haven’t made a zine since XOXO, and I was sick most of February, I got the XOXO Slack #mcelroys channel zine out today!
