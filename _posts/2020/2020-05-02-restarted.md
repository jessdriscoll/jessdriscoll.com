I restarted my newsletter in March, and now I’ve worked up to a regular schedule (I will probably keep my updates timed to my farmers market days). I’m genuinely enjoying putting this together every week, partly because I’m not blogging daily elsewhere. In the past, I’ve tried to do too much on a schedule, so I’m working hard at restraining myself, keeping my regular list small.

While everything has been mostly OK, and I have nothing big to worry about over the next few months, it’s also not been great. I would love to have some days where I just feel good and happy and looking forward to something exciting. Right now, all my focus is on my farmers market biz. Maintaining life has been difficult for me in the past, so I’m proud of the progress I’ve made. But now I want more.
