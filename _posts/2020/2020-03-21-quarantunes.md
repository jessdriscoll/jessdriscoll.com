It was inevitable; I created a quarantine playlist today. Yesterday, I wrote about discovering "Apparitions" is about quarantine. Today, QUARANTUNES includes (so far): 

- Raise the dead by Phantom Planet  
- Don't give up by Peter Gabriel and Kate Bush  
- Amerika by Wintersleep  
- My Sharona by The Knack
