As a very old Millennial, I pretty much gave up on new technology after Tumblr. When Instagram came out in 2010, Megan sent me the link, and I said, "The filters are cool, but why do I have to post them in the app?" I've had a blog since 2002; I don't need another place to put things. (I still signed up back then, and I've returned to Instagram again and again, and I'm currently there now.) 

I let Snapchat and Vine pass me by. As someone who has saved pieces of paper from elementary school onward, the idea of digital documentation that just...disappears? felt so odd to me. (I feel the same way about Instagram Stories: why not just post video??)

Now here we are in the streaming economy. Video games made sense, but I don't play much. Then visual artists, of course; I love watching people work. Maybe I could stream the writing of a novel, I thought? If I couldn't afford a retail space, perhaps I could create a virtual space. 

This morning, with unprecedented confidence, I did my first YouTube stream, with my computer's webcam aimed into my kitchen. I'm nearly positive now that the farmers market will be cancelled. The city has already shut down public spaces (libraries, rec centres, pools, arenas), and today, the schools followed suit. 

If we can't gather in the streets, perhaps we can peek into each other's kitchens. 

[This was my Very First Stream](https://youtu.be/nvnNZwqVT58), so forgive me looking like your not-cool mom, who just learned there's a camera on this thing. I'll be back tomorrow (so smash that subscribe button!) and you can watch me make breakfast. I have no classes to teach, so maybe I'll let you watch me do some writing, too.
