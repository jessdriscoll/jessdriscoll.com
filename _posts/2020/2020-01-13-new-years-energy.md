The contrast between my New Year’s energy (literal and figurative) this January and last is stark. I just can’t get myself going this year, and I don’t know why. I’m second guessing every choice and talking myself out of projects.

Even though I’m the furthest thing from a workaholic, I’m not very good at getting my brain to rest. I definitely feel adrift without a personal project to work on, and at the moment, that project is Quit My Dayjob And Go Independent. But that’s not a new project! And it’s also not going to be “done” this month (let alone this year).

My plans are all “keep going.” So how do we hold onto the excitement of the new, but apply it to the old? I think that’s where I am.

Gotta focus on the small shiny things, yes. This is good.
