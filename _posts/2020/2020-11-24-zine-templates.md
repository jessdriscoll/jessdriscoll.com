Because I haven't been baking, I've been writing. Or rather, I've been making zines. That doesn't always involve a ton of writing. In fact, most of zine making is cutting-and-pasting words I've already written. Two projects are now back online:

- [The General](http://jessdriscoll.com/thegeneral/) might still become a caf√©, but it's already a zine about food and cooking, which I created with Megan, and now all the previous issues are online for you to download and print at home. We've officially started writing volume 2 now.
- [Congenial Telegram](https://github.com/jessdriscoll/congenial-telegram) is both a zine and a repository. Both are about encouraging everyone that they can make zines, too! I made three issues of CT last year, and finally wrote #4 this month. You can download them all in the [/archives](https://github.com/jessdriscoll/congenial-telegram/tree/master/archives).
- In the [/templates section of CT](https://github.com/jessdriscoll/congenial-telegram/tree/master/templates), you can download the Pages templates I'm currently using to make my zines. All you have to do is reformat them to your style and add the words. The mini-zine template I uploaded today even has some of my own tips and tricks to help you get started!
