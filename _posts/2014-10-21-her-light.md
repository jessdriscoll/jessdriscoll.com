[HER LIGHT ALIKE](https://jessdriscoll.itch.io/her-light-alike) is a Halloween story about magical lesbians. Well, only some of them are magic. And some of them are bisexual. The book available 

Set in a coffeeshop known as a gathering place for magic practitioners, where the graffiti on the walls makes for some unexpected sparks on an open mic night, [HER LIGHT ALIKE](https://jessdriscoll.itch.io/her-light-alike) is a 12k erotic romance. There’s Vivian, whose grandmother owns the shop now, and their family for centuries before them, back when it was a temple. There’s Tamsin, who’s new to the tiny Greek island and looking to make friends. A love spell brings them together, but not in the way you’re thinking.

If you’re looking for some magic this October, [HER LIGHT ALIKE](https://jessdriscoll.itch.io/her-light-alike) is for you! I heard you like Halloween and queer characters, Internet, so I wrote something just for you.
