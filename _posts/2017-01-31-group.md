I started a new therapy group at the beginning of the month: depression management. So far, it's a lot of stuff I know, have learned before, but which I've never been able to put into action and actually, you know, feelÂ better. Something they want us to do is an activity checklist. They gave it to us on a piece of paper, but it was overwhelming. Tracking energy levels--morning, noon, and evening--as well as meals, thoughts, and social contact down to the minute.

I made my own in a spreadsheet. Just nine objectives each day. I was tempted to add one more for the symmetry, but nine is enough. I printed it and stuck it to the inside of my door where I'd see it every day. So far, it's working. It's the action I've been looking for, with a tiny bit of validation in that unbroken row of penciled checkmarks.
