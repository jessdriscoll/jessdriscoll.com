On Wednesday, I started rewatching THE OC for the first time since I watched it on TV. The show premiered the summer of 2003, the year I went away to college, and it ended with a fizzle and a shortened season in 2007. The first thing you notice is how long ago 13 years was. Ryan uses a payphone. Seth's iPod looks thicker than a pack of cards. Dark and light chunky streaks was the hairstyle of choice for women. Only 2003, but it already feels like a period piece. It feels like those 13 years of my life have just disappeared. A lot like the days since Wednesday when I started this marathon. I didn't do yoga. I didn't write. I barely slept. But it's been cold and rainy, so maybe I deserved a few days to hermit and enjoy the past.
