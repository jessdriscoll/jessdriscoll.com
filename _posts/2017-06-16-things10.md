1. Casual Friday, when I wear leggings, t-shirt, sports bra to work because I teach elementary kids after school, and they literally don't care.

2. Last week, I met some of my friends from my yoga teacher training, and we all admitted we haven't done much practice since graduating. And then we created a class on the whiteboard ("Coming back to yoga"), and it was the first time I had been on a mat since March. As much as I needed that break after the six months intensive, I needed to come back, too.

3. I had almost forgotten about the OMs and the chanting. They've never been my favourite part of yoga, the biggest reason being because they're in Sanskrit, which I don't speak. I am not Indian. The chanting feels a lot like praying to me, and I am not religious. But I am spiritual. I do believe in connecting with yourself and the earth. When I meditate, a chant that works for me is, "I am OK." It's four syllables, like there are four elements, four directions, and four items on this list.

4. This weekend, I have no plans. That feels so good.
