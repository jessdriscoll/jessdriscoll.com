"a woman imagined that birds were attacking her when she went walking in the country; after several months of psychoanalytical treatment that failed to cure her of her obsession, the doctor accompanied her to the clinic garden and realized that *the birds were attacking her*. Woman feels undermined because in fact the restrictions of femininity undermine her."
Simon de Bouvier, The Second Sex

Believe women. If we wanted to lie for attention, we wouldn't make up such terrible experiences.
