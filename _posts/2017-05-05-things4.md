1. I really wasn't sure I wanted to watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxtLlByaYTc">Riverdale</a>. I adore Archie comics. I grew up with them. I read more Archie than books when I was in elementary school. And this series looked like it was trying too hard to be the "gritty reboot" for a new generation. But it surprised me. I really loved it. I described it in my rec to friends as "Archie comics crossed with Twin Peaks, Teen Wolf, and Gossip Girl." So if you like those things, you might like this.

2. Somehow, I had way more Starbucks rewards this month than my stars should've allowed. I know one extra happened because the barista voided my order when they ran out of quiche. I finally got the quiche yesterday (lots of spinach), and I tried the s'more frappucino on Wednesday (needs more marshmallow). I know rewards programs are all about tracking consumer spending, but if I'm gonna be spending there anyway, it's nice to get something extra with my late stage capitalism.

3. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQ1Jw3tmRxLW89yvgWLkArA">I've made five daily videos in a row!</a> It's been way easier than I thought it would be. And it really helps that nobody is watching right now. I'm not even watching them. I just turn on the camera, talk for a while, then upload without editing (though I have started adding a date title). It's good to have a goal for my mornings.

4. I'm really really lucky to be Canadian, and I never want to take that for granted.
