A Moveable Feast by Ernest Hemingway

>Her hawk's eyes were clear and calm. I knew everything was all right and was going to turn out well in the end when she leaned forward and said to me, telling me her great secret, "Ernest, don't you think Al Jolson is greater then Jesus?"
Nobody thought anything of it at the time. It was only Zelda's secret that she shared with me, as a hawk might share something with a man. But hawks do not share. Scott did not write anything any more that was good until after he knew that she was insane. (186)

> He's sitting in the living room in a red-and-white-striped shirt, suspenders still looped over his shoulders, drinking a beer with his buddies from the network whose names I still can't be bothered to remember, when I come down the stairs, wearing a white brocade dress with grey mink trim and long grey gloves. My mother is married to a fishmonger. My father is gay and lives in Paris. I am going to the ballet. (166)

January 15, 2002  
Barrel Fever by David Sedaris

>After that there was nothing left to say as nothing gets on my nerves more than someone repeating the same sentence twice.

>When I was a boy, the bathroom in our home had a spring-coil doorstop at the baseboard with a little rubber head, and I would pull it back and watch it vibrate from its fan of movement into a smaller and smaller object, until it was its ordinary, still, tiny self again. This is what sex looks like to me. (22)

February 10, 2002  
Bright Lights, Big City by Jay McInerney

>A random sampling of the titles induces vertigo: As I Lay Dying, Under the Volcano, Anna Karenina, Being and Time, The Brothers Karamazov. You must have had an ambitious youth. Of course, many of these spines have never been cracked. You have been saving them up. (39)

February 28, 2002

Maybe (Maybe Not) by Robert Fulghum

>If you ever could attend a performance of the Minneapolis Chamber Symphony when it plays out in the small towns of rural Minnesota, you might notice an empty chair just to the right of the double bass player and just behind the violas. The orchestra voted to put it there permanently. The chair is for those who always wanted to be part of the symphony not just as listeners, but among those upon whom the making of music depends. It is the chair in honour of all those who, however competently, embrace the impossible. Sit in that chair someday. (188)

May 10, 2002

True Love by Robert Fulghum

Our Noise by Jeff Gomez

>There's only one store left, the Record Rack, the hairy chain in the mall that charges sixteen dollars for Pearl Jam's Ten and still keeps it in the New Releases bin even though it came out ages ago, as if some sailor is going to wander in after being out to sea for two years and be all, "Whoa! When did this come out?" and plunk down a twenty and not even wait for the change. (96)

May 31, 2002  
American Whiskey Bar by Michael Turner

>I assure you that I will continue to go out of my way to tell you, if ever you want me to at any time, at any place, wherever you may be everything this movie has done, everything this movie is capable of doing, and, for as long as I live, everything this movie is not. (182)

Bridget Jones's Diary by Helen Fielding

December 30, 2002  
Running with Scissors by Augusten Burroughs

>I had my mother's eyes. Everybody always told me this. And it scared me that I had her eyes because I was worried that it meant I had whatever else she had back there that made her believe she could not only speak to the dead, but smoke cigarettes in the bathroom with them. (240)

December 30, 2002

Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil by John Berendt

Why I Write by George Orwell

>All writers are vain, selfish, and lazy, and at the very bottom of their motives there lies a mystery. Writing a book is a horrible, exhausting struggle, like a long bout of some painful illness. One would never undertake such a thing if one were not driven on by some demon whom one can neither resist nor understand.

Untangling my chopsticks: a culinary sojourn in Kyoto by Victoria Abbott Riccardi

>Everyday Japanese White Rice  
>1 1/2 cups short-grain rice  
>Place rice in fine mesh sieve. Rinse under cold water, using your hand to gently stir until the liquid runs clear, about 2 minutes. Transfer rice to heave-bottom saucepan. Add 2 cups cold water. Let soak for an hour. Bring rice to boil. Reduce heat to low and cook, covered, for 10 minutes. Turn off heat and rest, covered, for 10 minutes. Remove lid and spoon out the rice with a wooden rice paddle (or spoon). If by chance some rice sticks to the bottom of the pot, don't despair! Simply spoon out all the soft grains, then scrape up the crispy bottom portion to eat as a snack sprinkled with coarse salt. Makes 4 cups.

And perhaps that might be the way to write this book--to open the page and to let the stories crawl in by themselves.

Nureyev: The Life by Julie Kavanagh

>He was also finding it hard to accustom himself to traditional English cooking, although it was two weeks before he confessed to hating cold roast beef. Beef–preferably in the form of an entrecôte steak–had to be thick, blue, and hot before he would eat it; when it arrived he would slice off a piece to see if it was rare enough, then test the temperature with his tongue–sometimes even his cheek. Only steak, he believed, could give him the extra stamina he needed onstage, and when Margot took him to meet her mother for the first time, they heard him mutter disapprovingly when the food appeared, “Chicken dinner, chicken performance.” (215)

When I am being kind, I think  
she's either blind

>The biggest moneymaking movie of 1986 was a Knights-of-the-Sky adventure pic that would have made Burgess Meredith and Hap Arnold blush: Top Gun. "Gentlemen," says our flight instructor, "this school is about combat. There are no points for second place." Young Tom Cruise was the lasciviously oiled, sun-burnished, leather-jacket-wearing, motorcycle-driving, soul-singing fighter pilot who overcomes self-doubt (a psychic leftover from his father's service record in Vietnam) and the training-exercise death of his best buddy/navigator ("Talk to me, Goose") to air-joust the Soviet MiG jets into bloodless submission and win the girl. Top Gun sold nearly fifty million tickets in US theatres.

Nor the acid with which I treat it. Glass breaks, glass is fragile, it does not endure. You can look at it, you can look through it, but you do not discover anything more the closer you look, glass is monstrous to sleep with. Handling and holding glass you yearn for flesh.'

Growing Pains by Emily Carr

>First we pretended that Epping Forest was our Canadian woods, but it was no good, there was not one bit of similarity. We gave up and sipped England's sweetness happily. Here were trees venerable, huge and grand, but tamed. All Englands things were tame, self-satisfied, smug and meek—even the deer that came right up to us in the forest, smelled our clothes. There was no turmoil of undergrowth swirling round the boles of trees. The forest was almost like a garden—no brambles, no thorns, nothing to stumble over, no rotten stumps, no fallen branches, all mellow to look at, melodious to hear, every kind of bird, all singing, no awed hush, no vast echoes, just beautiful, smiling woods, not solemn, solemn, solemn like our forests. This exquisite, enchanting gentleness was perfect for one day, but not for always—we were Canadians.

Emily Carr: New perspectives on a Canadian icon 

>Indian Art broadened my seeing, loosened the formal tightness I had learned in England schools. Its bigness and stark reality baffled my white man's understanding. I was as Canadian-born as the Indian but behind me were old world heredity and ancestry well as Canadian environment. The new west called me, but my old world heredity, the flavour of my upbringing, pulled me back. I have been schooled to see outsides only, not struggle to pierce… I learned a lot from the Indians, but who except Canada herself could help me comprehend her great woods and spaces?

If we can stand still and attentive in our lives and not run away, even right in the middle of the ruins, we will find fertile ground. We will hear the sound of a songbird in a Paris chestnut tree—we may not know whether the song comes from inside us or outside. We may never have been to Paris, but it doesn't matter. We are penetrated, through and through.

Perilous Trade: Book Publishing in Canada, 1946-2006 by Roy MacSkimming

>Scoffing at breathless media stories of young Japanese reading novels on their cellphones, older folks doubted that most North Americans would want to read long narrative texts on a small screen, however high-resolution. Instead, readers would continue to prefer that highly portable, sensually appealing, lovably familiar piece of technology, the book, so adaptable to bath, bed, or exercise bike.

You are a badass at making money by Jen Sincero

>I can’t tell you how much time I wasted (okay, forty years) pretending I could do things differently, instead of acting on ideas that seemed out of my reach or would have cost me money I didn’t want to spend. In other words, ideas that would have forced me to grow. I blazed by countless strokes of genius without even giving these ideas the time of day, just instantly tossed them aside as impossible. Next! Then back to complaining, spinning out, wondering why oh why can’t I get out of my suckhole? The Universe must have been like, I just gave you exactly what you asked for! Are you freaking kidding me?
