A Moveable Feast by Ernest Hemingway

>Her hawk's eyes were clear and calm. I knew everything was all right and was going to turn out well in the end when she leaned forward and said to me, telling me her great secret, "Ernest, don't you think Al Jolson is greater then Jesus?"
Nobody thought anything of it at the time. It was only Zelda's secret that she shared with me, as a hawk might share something with a man. But hawks do not share. Scott did not write anything any more that was good until after he knew that she was insane. (186)

> He's sitting in the living room in a red-and-white-striped shirt, suspenders still looped over his shoulders, drinking a beer with his buddies from the network whose names I still can't be bothered to remember, when I come down the stairs, wearing a white brocade dress with grey mink trim and long grey gloves. My mother is married to a fishmonger. My father is gay and lives in Paris. I am going to the ballet. (166)

January 15, 2002  
Barrel Fever by David Sedaris

>After that there was nothing left to say as nothing gets on my nerves more than someone repeating the same sentence twice. I think it's something people have picked up from television, this emotional stutter. Rather than say something interesting once, they repeat a cliché and hope for the same effect. (143)

January 17, 2002  
Mockingbird Years by Emily Fox Gordon

Obsessed, edited by Michael Lowenthal

>When I was a boy, the bathroom in our home had a spring-coil doorstop at the baseboard with a little rubber head, and I would pull it back and watch it vibrate from its fan of movement into a smaller and smaller object, until it was its ordinary, still, tiny self again. This is what sex looks like to me. (22)

February 10, 2002  
Bright Lights, Big City by Jay McInerney

>A random sampling of the titles induces vertigo: As I Lay Dying, Under the Volcano, Anna Karenina, Being and Time, The Brothers Karamazov. You must have had an ambitious youth. Of course, many of these spines have never been cracked. You have been saving them up. (39)

February 28, 2002  
The Object of My Affection by Stephen McCauley

>And New York seemed the likeliest place to go because I was convinced everybody ended up there at some point in their life anyway, and I figured I should get it out of the way while I still had the energy. (16)

Maybe (Maybe Not) by Robert Fulghum

>If you ever could attend a performance of the Minneapolis Chamber Symphony when it plays out in the small towns of rural Minnesota, you might notice an empty chair just to the right of the double bass player and just behind the violas. The orchestra voted to put it there permanently. The chair is for those who always wanted to be part of the symphony not just as listeners, but among those upon whom the making of music depends. It is the chair in honour of all those who, however competently, embrace the impossible. Sit in that chair someday. (188)

May 10, 2002

Me Talk Pretty One Day by David Sedaris

May 23, 2002  
True Love by Robert Fulghum

>The young woman said, "I love this couch. And now I'm looking for the right man to help me move it. Who knows what might happen?" Two young men, who had been listening, immediately volunteered. And off they all went together.
>The waitress from the espresso bar had the last word. "Veronica's getting really good at that story  it's the third time she's used it to get that damned couch moved." (201)

Our Noise by Jeff Gomez

>There's only one store left, the Record Rack, the hairy chain in the mall that charges sixteen dollars for Pearl Jam's Ten and still keeps it in the New Releases bin even though it came out ages ago, as if some sailor is going to wander in after being out to sea for two years and be all, "Whoa! When did this come out?" and plunk down a twenty and not even wait for the change. (96)

December 30, 2002  
The Virgin Suicides by Jeffrey Eugenides

Untangling my chopsticks: a culinary sojourn in Kyoto by Victoria Abbott Riccardi

>Everyday Japanese White Rice  
>1 1/2 cups short-grain rice  
>Place rice in fine mesh sieve. Rinse under cold water, using your hand to gently stir until the liquid runs clear, about 2 minutes. Transfer rice to heave-bottom saucepan. Add 2 cups cold water. Let soak for an hour. Bring rice to boil. Reduce heat to low and cook, covered, for 10 minutes. Turn off heat and rest, covered, for 10 minutes. Remove lid and spoon out the rice with a wooden rice paddle (or spoon). If by chance some rice sticks to the bottom of the pot, don't despair! Simply spoon out all the soft grains, then scrape up the crispy bottom portion to eat as a snack sprinkled with coarse salt. Makes 4 cups.
