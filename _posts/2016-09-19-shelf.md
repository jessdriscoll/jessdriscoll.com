I have a new bookcase. My grandparents are planning to move after forty years in the same house--my whole life in that one house. Job one is clearing it out. At the same time, my parents are attempting to do the same. They have no plans to move, but ten years and inertia have filled their house quickly. After house/catsitting for the weekend, I'm headed home with my grandmother's bookcase, a handful of my favourite knick knacks from my mother's shelves, and two more boxes of my books. Three generations of history coming together on the shelves in my house. Hand-me-downs are more than just free stuff.
