Butter tarts

1/3 cup butter  
1 cup brown sugar (not granulated)  
2 tbsp milk or cream  
1 egg  
1 tsp vanilla  

Beat all together. The butter might stay lumpy. 

Frozen tart shells  
1/2 cup raisins (we use dried cranberries)  
1/2 cup chopped nuts (we use pecans)  

Distribute fruit and nuts among shells. Spoon egg mixture on top. Fill generously. 

Bake at 450 for first 5 minutes. Reduce temperature to 350 and bake until the pastry is golden and mixture has puffed up. It will fall as it cools.

Serve with unsweetened whipped cream and eat plain. Good warm and cold. Freeze well. Absolutely necessary Christmas tradition.
