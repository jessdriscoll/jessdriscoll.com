The last time I was blogging regularly, I created a few routines to help myself write more. On Fridays, I wrote the same post: Four Things Working For Me This Week. 

1. I’m out of peanut butter, so as a snack this afternoon, I ate a peanut butter CLIF bar with a sliced red apple, and it was even better than I expected.
2. A simple recipe for a versatile creamy sauce: mayonnaise, Dijon mustard, apple cider vinegar, salt, pepper. Mix with shredded veg for coleslaw. Stir into cooked pasta. Dip chicken nuggets.
3. My mom used to buy a big flat of individual pudding cups for our school lunches. Vanilla, chocolate, butterscotch, tapioca. I was the one who ate all the tapioca. My current favourite is the Kozy Shack brand (on sale this week!)
4. I love potato chips more than almost anything. The best flavours are the ones which imitate actual potato dishes: baked potato, cheddar and sour cream, ketchup. Makes me wonder: shepherd’s pie chips?
