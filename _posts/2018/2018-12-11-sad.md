The weather affects me more than I know sometimes. I didn’t want to get out of bed this morning. I slept well. I’m even working on a project I’m excited about. But when the alarm went off, I just couldn’t do it. 

Through my bedroom window, I could hear the wind and rain. It’s still blowing now. The sky was grey all day. Days like this, they bring me down. 

They bring a lot of people down, I know, but I don’t have as far to go before I can’t get back up. 

No snow yet this season, which is unusual. November often brings the first fall. The closer we get to Christmas, the less I believe it will be a white one.
