I forget that I live in a very large country. Canada is an Iroquois word which means “village,” and Canada feels, sometimes, like a village pretending to be a country. There are times when it feels like a village and there are times when it feels like we may never come together as a country. We have forgotten how to speak each other‘s languages, if we ever bothered to learn. There aren’t many people here. But there is a lot of land here, and I have not seen it all. I have not seen enough. Even the city where I was born, where I was raised, where I have a live for nearly all of my 36 years, even this city is a strange place to me. I have not seen everything. I have not gone everywhere. I have not walked every street, every path, every coastline. So that‘s what I am trying to do.
