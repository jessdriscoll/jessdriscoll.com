Though I will probably work a few days next week, I’ve started preparing to pack up and head over to my parents’s house this weekend to start the Christmas holidays. The last day of school is late this year. Next Monday is already Christmas Eve.

I realised that meant I would need refills of my medication before I leave. (My parents are only 30 minutes away, but it’s inconvenient at best.) I also have my appointment with the psychiatrist this Thursday, and the number one thing I want out of it is a different prescription. It’s just bad timing all around.

But then there’s Christmas, New Year’s, and my birthday. There’s not a lot great about a holiday birthday, but I love the fresh start of the new year. I get to turn over one big leaf, all at once, and try again in 2019.
