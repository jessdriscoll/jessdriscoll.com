Today, a student asked me how many sentences I say in a single day.

"A million?!"

No way.

"A thousand?!" 

Maybe?
       
I live alone. I talk with my family and friends by text. My grandmother is the only person who phones me and doesn't want to sell me something (usually, she's trying to get rid of surplus kale). I
use the self-checkout at the grocery store. I order coffee with an app. If I wasn't a teacher, I wouldn't talk all day. 

So I make it a game. 1 point for saying “hi” to a stranger. 2 points for small talk. 5 for a compliment. I don't give myself points for teaching; I'm already getting paid.
