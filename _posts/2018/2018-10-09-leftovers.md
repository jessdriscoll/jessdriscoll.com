I was still sitting at the kids’s table when my mom decided she wanted to do Thanksgiving and Christmas dinner at home. My grandma didn’t cook it the way my mom wanted it. 

So we made our own traditions at home. My mom likes bread stuffing instead of rice. My brother has to have red cabbage. Most of us don’t like pumpkin pie. I love anything I can top with whipped cream. 

But the best reason to cook a holiday feast yourself is the leftovers. This morning, I had blueberry pie (and whipped cream) for breakfast. For dinner, a messy bowl of mashed potatoes, stuffing, Brussels sprouts, squash, turkey, and gravy. It doesn’t look as good as it did on the table yesterday. But tonight, all I had to do was heat it up. 

And there are still more leftovers for tomorrow.
