I almost forgot to write today. It’s been raining a lot here, so I’ve been hibernating—staying indoors with a stack of books. Today, I had to work. Luckily, the rain held off until I reached my office. Unluckily, it was pouring when I walked home. 

At one point, a car drove by and splashed me with an epic wave, that classic city scene. 

By the time I got home, all I wanted was to put on my pyjamas and eat dinner. I’m already in bed now, ready to go to sleep before 10. 

But before I do, I’m going to write about my day and post it online. Because this is important to me. I’ve been blogging for years, but now I’m making it a habit. This is what I do. Every day. It won’t always be my best. But I’ll try again tomorrow.
