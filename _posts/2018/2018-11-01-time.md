Today feels like a Friday. My last class at 5:30 dragged. Even my students were tired. I let them distract me with random questions instead of making them write their vocabulary sentences. 

Because we don’t have classes on Wednesdays, they missed out on our usual costume contest. Each year, the students who dress up tour each classroom, and the teachers get to pick their favourites. I tried to explain that next year, Hallowe’en will be on a Thursday. 

This took longer than I anticipated. These students are grades 3 and 4, but struggled to wrap their brains around the idea that dates can move. I explained the difference between dates and days. I explained that there are 365 days in a year, but only seven in a week. 

Being a kid means you don’t have to worry about time. Most of my students can’t read an analogue clock, not because they’re digital kids, but because time isn’t important to their lives yet. Their parents tell them when they have to be somewhere. I tell them when it’s time to go home. 

That’s why adults are nostalgic for the past. We want to recapture a bit of that time when it was someone else’s job to read the clock and mark the calendar.
