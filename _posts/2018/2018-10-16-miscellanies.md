1. I missed writing yesterday. As much as I can build and  automate my blogging workflow so I can do it anywhere, life will always get in the way. 

2. I’m still sick, but not really sick, which is annoying. If I was really sick, a weekend of tea, meds, naps, showers, and I’d be done with it. But this is not that kind of cold, apparently, and I’m still feeling low level crappy. 

3. Yesterday, I drove for the first time in almost two years. My learners license expired, and I had to take the written test again to renew it, and it took longer than I liked to psych myself up to that. But I got it done this summer, and now I have another two years of practice to try and pass the road test. Judging by yesterday’s performance and reported wait times for tests, it’s gonna take the full two years. 

4. If you, like me, are looking for a pure and wholesome distraction in this terrible world of ours, I recommend [Griffin McElroy’s attempt to beat a Pokémon game with extra silly rules.](https://m.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLaDrN74SfdT7gNxHr_hEtyaaCj0PN0O_j) I have still never played Pokémon, but this video series demands no previous knowledge. It’s a surprisingly heart-wrenching journey of a man trying to keep his ragtag collection of pocket monsters alive. I’ve rewatched it multiple times, most recently this weekend, between tea and naps.
