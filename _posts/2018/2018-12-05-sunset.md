The sky got dark before 4pm today. Official sunset was 4:13. I was already under my duvet, reading, because that’s the warmest place in my house. When I switched off my lamp to double-check, yes, that really was the sun going down in the afternoon, I left the light off and curled up to take a nap. 

One of those days when I just don’t feel good. It probably has a lot to do with the phone interview I did this morning: intake for a psychiatrist consult. I had to repeat the story of my depression, and instead of feeling like a burden lifted, that story sat heavier on my shoulders today. 

It’s hard to keep doing this and seeing no success, no relief. Nearly 8 months on my current medication, and just when I think it’s working, it’s not anymore. I need something that lasts. I want something more.
