I live in the north because I like the cold. But the world has changed. Summer comes early; it burns hotter and longer. We can't escape the sun any longer.
Find a seat near the window. Remember: the sun rises in the east and sets in the west. Orient your body accordingly.
Close your eyes. Follow the shapes of light behind your eyelids. Now remove your sunglasses. Notice the change. Feel the heat.
Lift a hand to block the sun. Move your hand through the light. Watch the shapes of dark. Now press the heels of both hands against your eyes. Make it dark. Make it darker. Make it darkest.
