I was doing so well. But I forgot to write yesterday. Oh well. Remember: you can always start again. 

When I was younger, the time between Christmas and my birthday used to go so quickly. It was also the time between school terms, so I never wanted it to end. 

But now this liminal space seems to stretch out before me. I can’t see the end. I looked at the calendar this morning (I got a Women in Science calendar in my stocking this year, [illustrated by Rachel Ignotofsky](https://www.rachelignotofskydesign.com/)), and I realised I won’t go back to work until January 3rd. That’s a lot more time to enjoy the holidays. 

Yesterday, we had snow for the very first time this season. It didn’t last long, and it didn’t stick to anything, but I watched the fat white flakes falling, and I felt a little better about the world. Weather is changing, yes, faster here than places farther south. 

But we will adapt. We will make a green Christmas the kind to look forward to.
