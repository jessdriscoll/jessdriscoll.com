The one hiccup in my holiday was today: an afternoon of classes. But that’s done now, and I’m back at my parents’s. Christmas Day leftovers for dinner and *White Christmas* on DVD. 

Tomorrow, maybe some shopping? Or maybe I’ll just sit on the couch, finish one more book, and try to complete the rest of the NYT crossword calendar. Turns out my dad isn’t very good at crosswords. He can beat every other puzzle, but not these. So I’m on my own again. So far, Friday and Weekend puzzles have me stumped.
