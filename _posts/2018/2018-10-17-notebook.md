The last few pages of my notebook took a week to fill. Yesterday, I set a timer for 30 minutes and did some free writing, getting to the last page. Then I took a shower and forgot to go back to finish the book. I even added it as a task on my todo list. 

So I finally finished it today, and then started the next book. Over the last year, I’ve been experimenting with different planners and styles, but I always come back to One Book For Everything. It’s the only thing that works for my brain. I’ll probably never find The Perfect Notebook, but that’s OK because I fill them so fast. I like cheap ones that fit in my bag. 

I’d like to make Morning Pages a habit again, but that’s kind of what this is, this blog. My notebook doesn’t need structure. It’s just a blank piece of paper (well, lined) to write whatever I need to get out of my head in the moment. I don’t need a website, an app, or a pre-printed layout to do that. I’ve used all of the above before, but I always end up back here with One Notebook For Everything. 

This one is black, B5, lined, from Muji. The cover is blank, so I get to pick out new stickers to decorate it. In the back, I keep a list of what I did each day. In the front, I write. 

I keep hoping a new notebook will make things better, but that’s all up to me.
