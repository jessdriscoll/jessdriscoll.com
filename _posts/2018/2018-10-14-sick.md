Late last night, I felt a tickle in my throat, that familiar tickle which means I’m probably getting sick. When I woke up, it was to a sore throat. 

After a lazy day, a pot of tea, many naps, I’m not all the way sick yet, but it could happen at any moment. This is the life of a teacher. The germs have their own schedule, and they don’t care about you.
