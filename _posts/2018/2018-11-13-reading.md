I have four bookshelves of books I’ve never read. I’ve tried, but something else always seems more important, more appealing. One of my favourite things to do is browse the books at the library. I rarely leave without borrowing something. Even though I have four bookshelves of books I’ve never read.

When I went down to Eugene this weekend, I didn’t want to take the H.D. biography I’ve been reading. It’s too big, and it’s a hardcover. Not suited for travel. I ended up borrowing DEEP WORK by Cal Newport from the library on Thursday, then finishing it on the bus on Friday. 

There’s been a lot of talk about DEEP WORK on the internet since it came out in 2016. Something about the academic way people write about it, as well as the author’s uncommon name, had me picturing an older, white-haired man. The guy is younger than me. 

There are some very good ideas in this book, but it’s also infuriating. Every blurb on the back is from a man and nearly every anecdote inside as well. I didn’t count, but female voices in the book are surely less than 25%. This is usually enough to make me stop reading a book, but I was stuck on a bus with nothing else to read. 

When I got home, I grabbed a random book from a random shelf: WILDWOOD by Colin Meloy and Carson Ellis. It’s a massive chunk of book, more than 500 pages (with deckled edges, ugh), but I’m already on page 353. 

Another piece of evidence that my medication is finally working.
