Just when I think I’ve read every writing craft book ever, I found [WRITING IRRESISTIBLE KIDLIT by Mary Kole](https://kidlit.com/resources-for-writers/) at the library. I’m working on a middle grade novel, which is different than anything I’ve written before, but it might just be my niche. I have a built-in focus group of kids at work, and I already write short. 

I read through this book today, and even if you write for adults, I totally recommend it. It’s a practical and pragmatic guide written from the POV of a literary agent. It turned a lot of abstract ideas into concrete concepts for me. 

By the time I reached the end, my character had changed, their goals were different, and I had added a completely new setting. But all for the better (I hope).
