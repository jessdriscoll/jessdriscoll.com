To reward my newly rediscovered ability to read, I took a bag of books to the thrift store and left with two more. Oops. 

Today, I found:
- STONES by Timothy Findlay
- THE SECRET LIFE OF GLENN GOULD by Michael Clarkson
- SPECIMEN DAYS by Michael Cunningham
- GARBO by Antoni Gronowicz
- SMALL TOWN TALK: WILD YEARS OF WOODSTOCK by Barney Hoskyns
- ONLY SKEIN DEEP by Maggie Sefton
- THE HEART IS A LONELY HUNTER by Carson McCullers
- THE STONE ANGEL by Margaret Laurence
- COLLAPSE by Jared Diamond
- FALL ON YOUR KNEES by Ann-Marie MacDonald
- I COULD DO ANYTHING IF I ONLY KNEW WHAT IT WAS by Barbara Sher
- and, of course, 100% OFFICIAL ONE DIRECTION WHERE WE ARE OUR BAND OUR STORY
