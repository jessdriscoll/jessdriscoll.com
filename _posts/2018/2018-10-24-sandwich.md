One of my favourite things in the whole world is peanut butter. I love it on toast in the morning, particularly on crumpets or English muffins. I love apples cut up and dipped into peanut butter. If you really trust me, add a slice of cheddar cheese to the mix. 

I ate peanut butter sandwiches almost every day for my school lunch. We had to make our own lunch, especially in high school, and peanut butter and bread was easiest thing when I was tired in the morning. Sometimes with honey; sometimes with jam. 

But the greatest sandwich is this: two slices of homemade bread, peanut butter on one side, Nutella on the other side, sliced bananas, and then grill the whole thing in a pan with butter. I didn’t have any Nutella, but this is almost what I ate for dinner tonight.

Bonus: [I sing this song in my head](https://youtu.be/dgUxeBSchws) (or out loud if I’m alone) every time I eat peanut butter.
