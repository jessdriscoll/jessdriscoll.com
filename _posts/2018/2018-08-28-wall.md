How to make a game when you think you can't make a game

1. Come up with a clever title
2. Think up an idea that fits
3. Reject the first five (at least)
4. Pick one desperately as you run out of time
5. Figure out how players will win
6. Work backwards from there
7. Make it as simple as possible
8. No, simpler than that
9. Write the instructions in plain language
10. Call it an experiment and release it into the world
