This has not been a good week. Though I managed to put out [some art](https://jessdriscoll.itch.io/thunder-lightning), I’ve spent a lot of time in bed. After the slowest summer at work, our enrollment hasn’t bounced back yet, and I’m only working three days a week. This is unsustainable, and it means I have to officially look for a second and/or new job. 

This sucks for a lot of reasons, but it’s also the biggest trigger of my depression and anxiety. I worry about money a lot. It’s never not on my mind. Over-educated and underpaid, but thankful I paid off my student loans years ago, and I’m Canadian, so I don’t have to worry about healthcare. 

I worry about everything else though. I worry I can never stop working. I worry I can’t live by myself any longer. I worry I won’t make rent next month.
