Today is Election Day in America. It is inescapable, even on this side of the border. I can’t think of another country—not even our Commonwealth—that the CBC covers with a prime time panel of pundits. 

This midterm is unlike any other in my lifetime. For many, particularly for us on the outside, this is an election of hope. I hope that a Democratic Congress is enough to slow America’s spiralling democracy. I hope the people know we can hear their voices. I hope this small victory is enough to keep the country fighting another two years. 

It’s not over yet.
