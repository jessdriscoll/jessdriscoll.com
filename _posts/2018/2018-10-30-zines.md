Euzine will be my first zine fair, and I don’t know what to bring. I don’t know what’s going to sell. Even if I did have better numbers online, in-person sales are so different. I’m erring on the side of a few copies of a lot of different things rather than a lot of copies of a few things. 

At my next fair, I’ll know more. And at next year’s Euzine, I’ll know a lot. 

Today, all I can do is pick my favourites and hope others like them, too. That’s what I’ve been doing for years without much success. But selling online is like trying to sell in a crowded mall where everyone else is trying to sell to you, too. 

At least when I’m at Euzine, I know the people there love zines. That’s already a big step forward.
