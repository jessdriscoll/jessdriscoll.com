I go to sleep with my phone. I know it’s not healthy, but neither is my brain. The time before I fall asleep is when every thought I’ve ever thought gets spun up and spit back out for me to obsessively worry about again. 

So it’s nice to have a distraction. 

Over the last year, that’s been clips from the My Brother, My Brother, and Me podcast and also video game videos by two-thirds of those brothers. When I want to break that up with something different, I watch the BBC Farms again. 

By now, YouTube knows what I need, and this week, [Bob Ross painting videos](https://youtu.be/qTDQt_PdlYc) showed up in my feed. I just might make it to 2019.
