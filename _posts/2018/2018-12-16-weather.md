Halfway through the month, and still no snow. The last few years, have been the coldest in my memory. This year must be one of the warmest. 

A white Christmas is not common. Though I still hold onto the image of a traditional Victorian Christmas in my head, snow is not necessary. Nice, but now that I’m an adult, the best part of Christmas is the food. 

We usually get our first snowfall in November. But this winter has been nothing but rain. Rain is welcome when it’s warm. When it’s cold, I’d rather the powdery snow. 

Tomorrow is another day off for me. I haven’t been teaching Mondays or Wednesdays since the school year started. It’s frustrating, but worse is coming up with ways to get out of my house that don’t also cost me money. 

The weather isn’t on my side.
