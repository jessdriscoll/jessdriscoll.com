Slowly, I’m recreating the numerous blogs I’ve had over the years. By the time I’m done, these archives will go all the way back to 2002. I was 20 then, and my blog was hosted at blogspot.com. 

This afternoon, I uploaded posts from 2013. That was the year I published three romance novels and thought I might be able to make that a career. There were a lot of negatives in my corner (unemployed, back at my parents’s house, untreated depression), but I really did try. I wrote every day. I submitted a lot of stories. 

But I’m just not prolific enough to make enough money in the ebook economy. Today, my royalty checks are barely $2. 

I hang onto my blog archives because they remind me of how far I’ve come, how much I’ve changed. I hang onto my paper notebooks for the same reason. As time feels like it goes faster and faster, I need better ways to remember.
