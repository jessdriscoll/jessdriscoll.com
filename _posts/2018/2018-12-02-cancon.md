Combining my idea for [a single title zine with a regular schedule](http://jessdriscoll.com/blog/2018/11/21/monthly) and my idea to make [all Canadian content in 2019](http://jessdriscoll.com/blog/2018/12/01/seawall), I started designing the cover for what Iâ€™m only temporarily calling THE NORTH. 

It will be monthly, in print and digital, about anything Canadian I find interesting at the moment. I put this idea into the world to remind myself, to motivate myself, to keep myself accountable to art.
