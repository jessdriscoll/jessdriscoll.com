I’m home again after my trip to Eugene, OR, and I will certainly have lots more to write. But it’s cold, and I’ve been on the road since 8:30am. 

Today is Remembrance Day in Canada, but I lost my poppy somewhere on the trip down. Flags were flying at half-mast, but I wasn’t sure if it was for the veterans or for the victims of the most recent shooting. 

Here, Remembrance Day is an important holiday—important enough to subdue the post-Hallowe’en rush to start Christmas a few days at least. I asked a carful of Americans what they think about their own Veterans Day, and one said something very insightful:

>Memorial Day is for the dead, and Veterans Day is for the soldiers still living. 

Perhaps that’s why it so hard for Americans to confront.
