Nothing makes me happier than having a project. My brain has been like this since I was a kid. I would get fixated on a topic, then go out to learn as much about it as I could, to the exclusion of all else. It’s one reason I was a poor student at school; the teacher’s topics and mine just never seemed to line up. 

A short list of past obsessions (not in chronological order):
- Egyptian mythology 
- Ancient Greek and Roman mythology 
- Beat poets
- UFOs and the paranormal (yes, I loved THE X-FILES)
- The Beatles
- Brit pop
- Canadian music
- Canada, in general, honestly
- William Carlos Williams
- Emily Carr
- ANNE OF GREEN GABLES
- bread in all its forms
- MOBY DICK and whales
- official flags and other symbols of the countries of the world
- Shakespeare and the Elizabethan era 
- American politics and geography 
- ANGELS IN AMERICA
- Tennessee Williams

Some of these obsessions lasted a semester, a season, a year, or more. Some live only in my past; many live with me still. Where other children had imaginary friends, I had imaginary teachers who assigned me reading lists and essays. 

This month, instead of writing a novel for NaNoWriMo, I blogged every day (except for the 10th, when I was selling at Euzine and in the United States with spotty internet). Ever since I returned from XOXO at the beginning of September and started this blog because what I had to say about the experience was too expansive for Twitter, I’m back into blogging and in a big way. 

I tried last year, on Wordpress, but the UI made blogging feel like a chore. I hated the act as much as I loved the writing. Here, on GitHub, blogging just feels like writing. I’ve created a workflow (ugh) that works for me. 

So in December, my imaginary teacher has challenged me to keep going.
