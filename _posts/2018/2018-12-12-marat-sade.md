I have a current writing project, but I’m not gonna talk about it. I’m going to keep it to myself until it’s done. 

As much as I would love to write all day on my day off, that’s not how I or most writers work. A few sentences, then a mental break, then back to sentences. I needed a book to read during the breaks, instead of reading the Internet. I wanted something short I could finish today. 

I read *The Persecution and Assassination of Jean-Paul Marat as Performed by the Inmates of the Asylum of Charenton Under the Direction of the Marquis de Sade* by Peter Weiss. 

>Marat we’re poor and the poor stay poor / Marat don’t make us wait any more / We want our rights and we don’t care how / We want our Revolution NOW

(We could use a revival now, too.)

The play is written in short scenes with headings, which makes is easy to read just one as a break. And it’s fantastic writing. I like to have good sentences in my head. 

When I chose this book, I was thinking it would feel good to finish something today, because the writing isn’t close to being finished. But I actually wrote a lot more than I expected AND read two books (*Marat/Sade* and *Adventures in Babysitting*, one of my favourite movies). 

It was a pretty good brain day.
