Depression, for me, makes the little things hard. I need gentle reminders. A list in a notebook or app or stuck on my fridge is too easy to ignore. I needed something physical. So I made these cards. They are index cards cut in quarters. I keep them together with a bulldog clip. Throughout the day, as I complete a card, I turn it upside down. One edge of each card is coloured, so I can see with a glance how many have been completed. Each day, I start over. The goal is never to do all my cards. The goal is to do something.
