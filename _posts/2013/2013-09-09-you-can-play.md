[Manchester Monarchs - You Can Play](http://www.youcanplayproject.org/videos/entry/you-can-play-manchester-monarchs)

Aaron Buckley is a fictional character, but his team is not. They're the Manchester Monarchs, the AHL team affiliated with the LA Kings, and this is them in real life, showing their support for athletes like Aaron.  

You Can Play is a pledge, spreading through college, minor, and professional sports, to welcome LGBTQ athletes with tolerance and acceptance. It's for the athletes already playing, for those to come, and especially for those who might choose to give up the sport they love because they don't feel safe and they don't feel like they belong.  

I hope the Monarchs don't mind I borrowed them for [HOME TEAM](https://www.dreamspinnerpress.com/books/home-team-by-jameson-dash-2792-b). They get to win a game against the Wolves, and I gave them a very talented first round draft pick. They gave me a safe space for Aaron, where he might be able to find himself and where he's not afraid to be that person.
