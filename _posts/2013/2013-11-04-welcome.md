>A landscape like this, which stretches not only the eye but the soul, can be marketed, and the government’s Bord Fáilte (Board of Welcome) does so vigorously. 

John J. Putman, “A New Day for Eire”, National Geographic April 1981. In Ireland, their word for tourism means “welcome.” I find that so charming. (Also, Board of Welcome is a great band name/book title/URL.)
