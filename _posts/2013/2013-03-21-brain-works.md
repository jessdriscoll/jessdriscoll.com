Let me tell you a story about how the brain works.  

I'm working on the first round of edits for my second novella (Out in May! Watch this space!), which means it's the first time I've read it since I wrote it in November. A month ago, I wrote a short scene as a release day extra, in which I put one of the characters in a hot pink suit. I don't know exactly why I did that, except that it seemed right. It seemed right because, back in November, I wrote this:  

>He has his earphones in, too. Matthew can see them from here because they're hot pink.  

I didn't remember that. My brain did.
