I made a big mistake yesterday. I got up in the middle of a paragraph to pour my tea, and when I came back to the computer, I had completely forgotten what I was writing. I know I had a great idea, because I jumped ahead ten thousand words to write it. It sucked, for about an hour. But that's the best thing about having simultaneous projects. I clicked over into another of the three Scrivener docs I currently have open on my desktop, and I kept working. I'm back at it today. The same paragraph, but a new idea. Because there are always new ideas.
