I've been having a good writing week. But having a good writing week means I'm thinking less and doing more. Which means I have less to talk about here. Rather, I have less I CAN talk about here. I'll tell you the what, but less about the who, how, and why. (Well, the why is because I want to.) Writing stories is telling stories, whatever form that may take. My preferred form, of course, is writing. But sometimes, talking about a story can kill my need to write a story. I will have other interesting things to talk about here. But it won't be about the sequel. Not until I have a release date to tell you about.
