[YouTube - Station X](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-Q3Zv582Q0) 

I finally watched THE BLETCHLEY CIRCLE last night, which means I also spent a lot of time on Wikipedia last night. This is an OK documentary if you want to know more about the codebreakers at Bletchley Park, but the best parts are the reunions. They gathered together these women, who broke codes at Station X, who transcribed Morse code in far-flung Y stations, who did the actual work of maintaining Alan Turing's deciphering machine, who did the typing, the filing, the indexing. Most of them hadn't talked about what they did during the war since the war. They all look and talk like my own British granny, trading stories and photos over tea at The Enigma Tavern, except they can still recite the lists of codewords they used in the 1940s and recall practical jokes they played on visiting Admirals.
