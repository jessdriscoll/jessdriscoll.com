i missed the deadline for the other sports call, but that's ok because i can hit one later. i made the mistake of looking at amazon to see if anyone had rated or reviewed my book, and they had, and they didn't like it. i'm ok with that, but it still sucks, and it still makes my stomach feel tight and queasy, and now i'm even more worried about the next thing coming out, and the next thing i'm writing. so i need to work on plot. it's my biggest problem, and arguably, the biggest part of a book. usually, i write everything with characters at the core, but i'm working my way up. if i want to write a novel, i need to get better at plot. 

ok. 8k. but i still need a plot. and i need to write some goddamn words before the day is over. these 350 here don't count.
