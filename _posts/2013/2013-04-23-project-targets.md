Because I'm working on revisions this week, instead of writing something new, I don't have the Project Targets box open in Scrivener like I usually do. Unlike everything else I write, I'm not worried about word count right now. I use word count to plan, to structure, and to write my books.  

A thousand words is a nice chunk that I can see in my head. It's a good size for a scene with a beginning, middle, and end. It's also a good goal for every writing day. So, if I want to write something twenty thousand words long, all I need is about a month, twenty plotted scenes, and the Project Targets box open in Scrivener. Editing is a different thing all together. It doesn't matter how long the book is because it's already long enough (though I always want it to be longer). I'm rereading and rewriting sentences--a few words here, a few more there. There will be new paragraphs in the last half to bolster dropped story threads.  

But it's harder to look at a day's work editing and feel like you did something. The progress bar doesn't move at this stage of the book like it does at the beginning. Sometimes I wish I had a progress bar for quality. Instead, I close the Project Targets box and write, delete, move sentences around until the book is good enough for me. Because that's what I want to give to you.
