While with FSA, she kept detailed notes on the tent camps of the Dust Bowl migrants to California, that were loaned to John Steinbeck by her supervisor Tom Collins.

Bennett Cerf planned to publish the novel with Random House, but the appearance of Steinbeck's The Grapes of Wrath caused publication to be shelved in 1939. Her novel didn't get published until 2004.
