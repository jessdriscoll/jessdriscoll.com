The best advice I can offer any writer is this: write, finish what you write, put it out into the world, but keep on writing. That keep on writing rule is so hard, but so important.  

Since I wrote the thing which became A GREAT ROUGH DIAMOND, I have written three more novellas, all of them longer than the last. I couldn’t have written those if I hadn’t finished the first, but also if I had spent those months following worrying about how I was going to make money off of it. It’s easy to get sidetracked with revising and second-guessing. So I submitted it and moved on to the next.  

Now the first book comes out this Wednesday. I’m writing the fifth right now. And before the end of the month, I’ll have a second cover to show you all.
