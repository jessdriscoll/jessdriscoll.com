COUNTRY MESSES, a short novella with Torquere Press, will be released May 15th.  

>Matthew loves his dog and his garden. He doesn't love the club scene. But just when he's decided to stop looking for love, Amie drags him away to her grandparents' beach house, where they discover Louis, her cousin, has been hiding out all summer. He's there trying to write a musical; Matthew is trying not to make a fool of himself in front of his three best friends. It's summer savory which brings Matthew and Lou together, in the garden, near the beach, on the last weekend before summer comes to an end.  

Where A GREAT ROUGH DIAMOND is snow and winter, COUNTRY MESSES is sun and summer, just in time for the May long weekend reading.
