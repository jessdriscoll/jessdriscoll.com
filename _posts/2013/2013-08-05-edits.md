The first edit is the worst. Nothing fits. You can't make sense of it. Your book is terrible.  

The second edit is better. You actually want to read the thing. This edit feels easy. It feels like you're almost done.  

The third edit is when you realise this book is about to come out. Suddenly, that whole scene in the apartment doesn't fit anymore, and the timeline is off, and god, should that girl's name be something else? This is the serious edit. This is the one you think should take a day, and it takes you all week.  

The fourth edit is when you accept all changes because you can't stand to look at it anymore. Publish, I don't care. Take it off my hands, please.  

The fifth edit is when you have to change a glaring typo that a very nice reader sent along in an email, three months after the release date.
