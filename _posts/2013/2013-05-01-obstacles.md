It's been a while since I've written something so short (aiming for four thousand words). It's like whiplash, yanking me back to where I started, after I worked so hard to make each book longer than the last. I don't write long easily. My longest yet is only 20k. I'm too good at getting my characters to their happy ending. Like athletes who play themselves into shape after injury and recovery, I'm writing myself into a novel. Each time I finish a book, I learn something new: how to balance supporting characters, how to weave in a subplot, how to drag out the resolution, and how many obstacles can I write. That's hard. Four thousand words should be easy, but I'm still sitting here writing, with my timer, my apps, and my tea.
