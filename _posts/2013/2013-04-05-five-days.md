Five days until A GREAT ROUGH DIAMOND comes out. I know that publication day is April 10th, and I know that we are right now in the month of April, but it didn’t hit me until I saw my cover on the Torquere blog, along with the rest of next week’s new releases. This is a real thing that exists, and you all get to read it in five days.

Speaking of the blog, I’ll be posting there and on Livejournal all day on April 10th. Tag your comments, questions, and reviews with #greatroughdiamond so I can see them all here and on Twitter. Tell your friends. Buy the book. Enjoy. And thank you.
