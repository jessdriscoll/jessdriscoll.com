We literally just decided on the cover this afternoon, after a little back-and-forth and typeface confusion. I'm so excited, and I can't wait for you all to read this book.  

A GREAT ROUGH DIAMOND comes out April 10th, from Torquere Press. This is the front cover; here's the back blurb:  

>When Charlie tours with his band, Wes stays home in Chicago. Wes thought that life was working for them, but in the middle of a snowstorm and a welcome home party for their newly-married best friends, their relationship comes to a sudden, drunken crescendo.  

Stay tuned for the lead-up to publication day. I'll have bonus stories and art for you, and any other fun extras we can come up with.
