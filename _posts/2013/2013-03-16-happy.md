A friend said to me last night, You look happy. And you're not a happy person. He was right on both counts. But, on Thursday night, I finished a novella which took up most of February, and I submitted it to Carina Press. In the morning, I sent out a couple of queries. I approved the cover to my first Torquere novella, and then the first round of edits for the second arrived.  

I'm excited and nervous and just about to jump off a cliff, but I think I might be happy.
