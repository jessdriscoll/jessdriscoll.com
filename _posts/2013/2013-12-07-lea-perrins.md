>In Canada, Lea & Perrins Worcestershire sauce is identical to the standard British version. It is imported from England and has the same bottle. The label is similar to the British version, but modified to include French text.

I can tell where you're from by how you pronounce "Worchestershire." No one I know even calls it "Worchestershire." We just call it "Lea and Perrins." This is, coincidentally, the most accurate definition of Canada I've ever found: "Similar to the British version, but modified to include French text."
