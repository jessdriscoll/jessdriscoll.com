Twelve Days of Kinkmas, a Christmas anthology from Ravenous Romance.

>Reese meets his angel when Patrick auditions for the St. Luke's Christmas Revue. The two men explore their fantasies in that same church, where Reese found his own awakening, so many years ago.
I made Patrick an aerials performer, because I was curious what kinds of things you could get up to with those long lengths of silk. Some very nice things, turns out. You can pick up this story right now, with eleven more to read before the twelve days of Christmas are over. 

I wrote a story called ANGEL ON HIGH for this anthology. It's a little bit Christmas-y and a little bit bondage-y. Just in time for the holidays.
