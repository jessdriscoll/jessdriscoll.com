That's it for this book. On to the next one. Thank you to everyone who bought it, read it, and passed it on with a reblog or a retweet. I could keep talking about [this book](https://www.dreamspinnerpress.com/books/home-team-by-jameson-dash-2792-b), but that would start to get boring for me, as well as for you. The writing is my favourite part of writing. There is an oft-repeated maxim that ideas are easy, writing is hard. 

If writing is easy, marketing is hard. Marketing is putting yourself and your book out there and hoping someone looks up and takes notice. Marketing makes me want to run back to writing. I hope I get better each time around, learning what works and what doesn't. I'd love to know why you decided to buy this book last week. I hope I can convince you to do the same, when the next one comes around.
