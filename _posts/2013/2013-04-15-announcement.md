A GREAT ROUGH DIAMOND is out there right now, and COUNTRY MESSES is coming out next month, but this weekend on Twitter, I announced that I have signed a contract with Dreamspinner Press to publish what I'm calling THE HOCKEY NOVELLA until it gets a better title. It will likely come out this fall, September or October, which is perfect, just in time for the start of the new hockey season--we hope. :)
