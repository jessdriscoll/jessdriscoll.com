So happy to start the week off with the cover of my third book, [HOME TEAM](https://www.dreamspinnerpress.com/books/home-team-by-jameson-dash-2792-b), coming September 25th from Dreamspinner Press. Doesn’t that guy look good? That’s Aaron, and you’re going to meet him soon.

>After fifteen years playing pro hockey, Aaron Buckley screws up, and his mistake and his attitude get him sent down to the minor leagues. His new team is in his old city, where he started his career in hockey, and also where he left his boyfriend behind. His luck hasn’t improved since joining a team of rookies and kids, but he has discovered that Zach--the ex-boyfriend who could never compete with hockey for Aaron's love--is still in town. Aaron has a second chance to answer the same question: Zach or hockey? But maybe it’s time for a new question.

When I started writing this one in January, not many outside of basketball knew Jason Collins. I knew the Big Four sports would see an openly gay player soon. I just didn’t know it would be in the time between me selling a story about a hockey player in the closet and me releasing a story about a hockey player in the closet.  

HOME TEAM comes out in a month, but you can pre-order it now, and of course you can show all your friends my awesome cover.
