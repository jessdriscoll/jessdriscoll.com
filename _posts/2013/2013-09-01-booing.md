>I think the fact women's sports is now getting there, to start booing players, that for me means we're doing something right.

[Abby Wambach, in an article about the Canada/US women's soccer rivalry.](https://nationalpost.com/sports/soccer/canada-u-s-rivalry-led-by-christine-sinclair-abby-wambach-a-building-block-for-womens-soccer) I want to hate her (because rivalry, Olympics, SO MANY REASONS), but dammit, I agree. When sport makes space for women to be villains on the field, ice, court, instead of cooing over the ladies and their pastimes, that's important and worth celebrating. Sport, especially team sport, is a narrative, playing out over a season, in changing settings with changing characters. We cheer for heroes who score goals, but there have to be villains, too, who welcome the boos.
