My team--the Vancouver Canucks--are down three games in the first series of the Playoffs. Last night's game was a bad one. I watched most of it on mute with my stomach tangled up.

It's hard to be a fan. To be a fan is to care about something over which you have no control. I can't get on the ice with those guys and block a shot. I can't fix them up after they get hurt. All I can do is watch and cheer and hope.

There's not a lot of hope in this city right now. The team is playing in San Jose, but still. The city felt eerie quiet last night. Maybe that's just me. Maybe that's just me, holding onto the last scrap of something because we're going to need it for the next game.

The team is going to need everything we have.
