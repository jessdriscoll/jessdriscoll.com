Blah blah blah, which is how I used to always start writing when I didn't know what to write. I keep hoping that if I start, I'll figure out what this story is supposed to be about. But it hasn't happened yet. I need to just get ahead and write the sex. Then write the story around it. But to write the sex, I need to know the characters. And to know the characters, I need to know the story. It's the worst kind of catch-22. I wish I could write fic and just change the names, but my morals won't allow it. This is why fic is easy. I don't need to spend so much time figuring stuff out. I can just write stories and people know. They don't need to be told.
