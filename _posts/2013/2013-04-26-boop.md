>Sometimes I go weeks and weeks and weeks, I don't need a boop from anybody. And then other times all of a sudden, I send a boop out, I don't get a boop back in five or six minutes, and then I'm literally up a tree. I have to go climb a tree, and I'm up there pulling my hair out about 'Where's the boop back?'
