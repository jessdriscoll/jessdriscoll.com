>For my own part, I must confess that I could never see any beauty in her. Her face is too thin; her complexion has no brilliance; and her features are not at all handsome. Her nose wants character--there is nothing marked in its lines. Her teeth are tolerable, but not out of the common way; and as for her eyes, which have sometimes been called so fine, I could never see anything extraordinary in them. They have a sharp, shrewish look, which I do not like at all; and in her air altogether there is a self-sufficiency without fashion, which is intolerable.

Miss Bingley tries to turn Mr. Darcy away from Elizabeth.

One of the first things I noticed about Austen's writing is the lack of description. I noticed it because it's how I write, too. We're told by many different characters that Jane is the most beautiful of the Bennet girls, but we don't get a surplus of adjectives. We believe it because the characters tell us, not the author. 

It means even more when the first time we get a physical description of Elizabeth, it's from Caroline, who has her own motives, and by this time in the book, we know they're not good.
