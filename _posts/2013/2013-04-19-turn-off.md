Like a lot of you out there, I’ve been watching too much cable news, finding too little information, and following too many hashtags. This week, as The Onion put it, Jesus, this week.  

I’m not a journalist. I’m not a cop, or a paramedic, or a politician. I’m not even American. I’m a writer. I write happy endings because we need more of them in the world. That’s what I can offer you–along with my sympathy–a few moments of quiet to curl up with a book and let someone else’s words take care of you.
It’s OK to turn off the TV and close Twitter. Go read a book. Be good to yourselves. Make next week the best.
