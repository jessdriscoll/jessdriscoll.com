Read it backwards. I start at the end and read up the page, by paragraph and also sentence by sentence. What you're doing is breaking the familiar flow of story that your brain expects. You're forcing yourself to look at each sentence as a separate thing.  

Read in sections. I knew I had to finish this job yesterday, so I set myself a timer. I read for 15 minutes. I took 5 minute breaks. It not only kept me on track, it was one more way to keep my brain awake and not let it sink into the flow of the story.  

Read out loud. Your brain thinks it knows the story. When you read it out loud, you discover it doesn't. Two fixes I made yesterday because they didn't "sound" right: the word "apologize" ending two sentences in a row and switching an oft-repeated pronoun for something more specific. When in doubt, go for something more specific.
