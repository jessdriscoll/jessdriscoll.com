This was already going to be a busy week. I have a short story to finish, which is already more than 10k. I have a sequel to write, which is giving me grief. I have [HOME TEAM by Jameson Dash](https://www.dreamspinnerpress.com/books/home-team-by-jameson-dash-2792-b) coming out tomorrow.

I will never have enough time to write everything I want to write. Which is why I’m glad I got the hockey romance out of the way early. It really was inevitable. Hockey has been a story in my life since the very beginning. 

The first time I fell in love with hockey was the second time my team made it to the Stanley Cup Final. (We lost, we had lost before, we would lose again, but there’s always next season.) It was the first time I saw how hockey is a narrative, how rivalries play out over a season, how trades pit friends against each other, how sudden death overtime raises the stakes. I didn’t know then I could turn it into a love story. A writer should write what they know goes the common advice. Better advice: write what you love.

It will show through with every word. Not only in romance, but in everything. I write about hockey because I want hockey to be better. I want the sport I love, that, as a Canadian, I hold as a part of my identity, to open itself up to all athletes. That’s why I wrote this version of a world where it’s time for Aaron to come out. After so many years hiding himself away, he finds himself in the right place, and with the right people, where coming out can be something to think about, instead of ignore. It doesn’t have to be a scary thing. It can a powerful thing.

[HOME TEAM by Jameson Dash](https://www.dreamspinnerpress.com/books/home-team-by-jameson-dash-2792-b) is just a book, a short and fluffy one at that. Maybe one day, maybe soon, it won’t seem so much like fantasy fiction. But I’ll keep writing what I love, if you’ll keep reading it.
