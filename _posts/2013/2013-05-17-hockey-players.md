>Hockey players are different than other athletes. You get hit in the face and they get cut and you go in and you get sewed up and you come back out and play. I've very seldom in 30-something years seen a player that doesn't do that.. Spit your teeth in your hands. 'Put me in, coach.'

Los Angeles Kings coach Darryl Sutter

There’s a reason you can (and many reporters do) describe all my favourite players as “carrying the team on his back.”
