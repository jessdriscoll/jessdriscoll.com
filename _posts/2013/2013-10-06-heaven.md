[Bryan Adams - Heaven](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6TtwR2Dbjg)

I went to a party in high school where a girl played this song on an infinite loop. This was early days of CD players, so maybe repeat didn't work that way yet or maybe she didn't know, but each time the song came close to ending, she got up and skipped it back to the start. I never went to another party at her house, and this song still gives me anxiety. I never know when it's going to end.
