My publisher, Dreamspinner Press, dutifully sends me reviews of [HOME TEAM](https://www.dreamspinnerpress.com/books/home-team-by-jameson-dash-2792-b). They even screen them beforehand, only sending on links to the positive reviews. I don’t read them. It’s nice to know they’re out there, I’m happy people are reading my books, and I’m grateful, but I’m just trying to make the next book better. 
Here are a few of the people who have enjoyed the book, and I thank them.

- Live Your Life, Buy The Book  
- Gay List Book Reviews  
- 3 Chicks After Dark  
- Joyfully Jay  
- The Novel Approach  
- Reviews by Jessewave Tourists
