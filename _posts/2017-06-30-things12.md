1. Not exactly sure yet what the Twitter app is doing for me this week, but we are what we repeatedly scroll. I didn't have a cell phone when I joined Twitter in 2006, but in 2010, when I bought my first--the iPhone 4--<a href="https://tapbots.com/tweetbot/">Tweetbot</a> was among the first apps I bought. This time around, though, I'm trying the official Twitter app, and except for the ads in my timeline, I like it.

2. As I look at Twitter now, at 9pm on the west coast, all the brands are firing up their social media celebrations for Canada Day tomorrow. If you, like me, are looking at that celebration and finding a lot of emptiness, follow <a href="https://twitter.com/Resistance150">@resistance150</a> for some different voices.

3. My anxiety management group ended this week. In two years, I've worked my way through most of the groups the mental health program has to offer. Now I wait, my name on a six-month list, for the last group, the next level: advanced self-reflection. Until then, I've expanded my list of little achievements in the back of my notebook to an hourly time log. It's too easy to let the morning get away from me, but having to face the truth of catching myself four hours in a row on Twitter makes me get up and do something else.

4. Häagen-Dazs gelato was on sale at the grocery store. Little achievements lead to little rewards. That's how I get myself to the end of every week.
