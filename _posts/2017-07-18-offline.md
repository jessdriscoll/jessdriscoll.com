I'm housesitting for the next few weeks. The good things about this are: a cat to pet, a back porch to sit on, and a different point of view. The bad things are this are: the terrible wifi that had me offline most of the day when I needed to be working in Google Docs.

I don't want to be addicted to the internet, but my anxiety was the worst it's been in months during those few hours. So that's another bad thing.
