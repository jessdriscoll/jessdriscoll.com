I’ve never been to Ibiza, but my characters start out in London, and an anniversary trip to an island just made sense. So I went searching for hotels with beautiful views and found the [Gran Hotel](http://ibizagranhotel.com).

It’s amazing what writers can do with the internet. I’ve never been to London either, but there are pictures and maps and Wikipedia. I looked at Yelp reviews and blog posts, and then I pieced it all together into something familiar, at least.

A city is a city, really. For Miles, it doesn’t really matter where they go, because wherever they go, people want Jeremy. They want to talk with him, make deals with him, probably dance with him, but Miles isn’t letting go of his hand. Their city could have been any city, but I chose Ibiza because of the music, and I gave them a history in that city, and then there’s that view.
