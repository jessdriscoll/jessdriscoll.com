Working through my back catalogue, I discovered some of my stories are not in plain text. That means I can’t access them on my phone. So I had to get onto my laptop, I had to open Scrivner, and I had to track down a whole bunch of stories I’ve written over the past five years. 

Plain text is so versatile. It’s the best way to store backups. I have copies of old blogs in text because you never know what will be compatible with the future. Plain text will always be compatible. 

But ePub is great for digital reading now. I’m working through my short stories written over the past five years, editing, formatting, creating simple, but well-designed books. 

FALL IN LOVE is my third story published this month. [I’ve created a collection](https://itch.io/c/400166/fiction) to make it easy to find all my fiction. Happy endings guaranteed.
