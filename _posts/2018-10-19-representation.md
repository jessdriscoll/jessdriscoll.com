I love [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/). They provide creators with beautiful public domain photography. I‚Äôve used the photos to make my book covers for years now. 

I made [a new one](https://jessdriscoll.itch.io/goddess) yesterday. But when I was browsing today with a specific idea in mind, I couldn‚Äôt find what I was looking for. 

Unsplash fails terribly when it comes to representing what our world looks like. Most of their LGBT+ category is rainbow flags, not real people. Most of the couples in the Love category are straight and also white. 

I prefer a minimalist aesthetic, something very different from traditional romance novels. (You saw the GODDESS cover, right? üçä) I‚Äôm not opposed to people on book covers, just those fake-looking romance men.

The world where Unsplash seems to live looks fake to me.
