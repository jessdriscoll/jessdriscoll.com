Day One of the STANLEY PARK SINGING EXHIBITION

+ The Evaporators: I've lived in Vancouver my whole life. I've been to concerts in Vancouver my whole life. And, though I've been in the crowd with Nardwuar, I have never seen Nardwuar sing. He certainly knows how to put on a show. Even for the people who won't get up and dance. 

+ Deerhoof: Three gangly spastic boys who don't sing and one tiny Japanese girl who does. Winning combination. 

+ Andrew Bird: Blue shoes, green socks, violin one man band, and he knows how to whistle. 

+ Destroyer: All my favourite New Pornos songs are Bejar's, but I still don't love Destroyer the same. Huge crush on his chatty keyboard player, though. 

+ Neko Case: Played new songs and all my favourites and is still the best stage banterer in town. 

Day Two of the STANLEY PARK SINGING EXHIBITION

+ Visqueen: I have one random song of theirs on my iPod. They didn't play it. But it was good to hear their others. 

+ The 1900s: Seven people on stage playing 17 instruments, but all eyes were on the female lead with her precariously buttoned shirt and rock tambourine. I would watch her shake that thing all damn day. 

+ Stevie Jackson: Starts with a couple of weak acoustic tracks until he announces that his other band is Belle & Sebastian, invites another B&Ser, a 1900, and half of the New Pornos on stage, and proceeds to rock the fuck out. 

+ Black Mountain: I find it amusing that I like bands influenced by bands which I don't like. But, you know, "Battle of Evermore" has always been my favourite Zeppelin song, and that's the one with the girl, and Black Mountain has a girl, so that's probably why they work for me. 

+ The New Pornographers: The hometown show always includes Bejar, which means they play my favourite songs, but there are four albums and some songs have to be left out. I'm just a little sad about the ones left this time. But they introduced me to all these other bands. They did good.
