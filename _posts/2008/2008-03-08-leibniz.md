Isaac Newton had some really great ideas about calculus in 1665, but he didn't publish them until 1704. Problem was, he couldn't keep his mouth shut and did a little bragging in his correspondence with Gottfried Leibniz. Leibniz cleaned up the equations, the notations, and published in 1684. Newton cries 'plagiarism,' and The Royal Society of London for the Improvement of Natural Knowledge agrees to an investigation. Except, who is President of the Royal Society when Newton decides to make this accusation?

Newton.

Word is the guy was a real dick. Too bad all anyone remembers is the appleâ€“this is so much more interesting.
