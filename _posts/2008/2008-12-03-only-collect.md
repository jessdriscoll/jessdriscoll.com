[Only Collect](https://idlethink.wordpress.com/2008/11/26/only-collect/) by Rachel Leow

There are some insights here that make me feel so good about being a hoarder, of my own ideas and those of other people, but, in a weird meta confluence, this post made me realise how I collect. I was gonna delicious this link and was debating whether to include the kottke via link, which, in turn, made me debate whether or not to just post to tumblr. Because this is how I collect now. More often than not, things go here. When, in a month, a year, five, I need to find something, I'll probably find something here.
