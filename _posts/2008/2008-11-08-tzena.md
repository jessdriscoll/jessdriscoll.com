[Tzena, Tzena, Tzena - The Weavers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZ5v651bQ1o) 

I was gonna post this and say, 'I love public domain songs,' but that's not true! It was, [according to Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tzena,_Tzena,_Tzena), "written in 1941, in Hebrew by Issachar Miron [he] (a.k.a. Stefan Michrovsky), a Polish emigrant to what was then the British Mandate of Palestine (now Israel), and Jehiel Hagges [he] (Yechiel Chagiz)." True, many people since shaped it into the version The Weavers made famous, but, honestly, it's the "Tzena, Tzena, Tzena" that gets me every time.
