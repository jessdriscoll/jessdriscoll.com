Henry Lewis Mencken and George Jean Nathan: best friends, co-founded SMART SET magazine, Nathan worked in NY, Mencken from Baltimore. Post-WW1, Mencken wanted a more lavish and prestigious magazine, so he ended SMART SET and started AMERICAN MERCURY. Wrote a letter to Nathan asking him to resign since they were drifting apart. There's a story there somewhere. I'm not taking this one. I'm not writing this one. Someone else has to write this one. I'm gonna teach myself to pick a story and stick with it until it's finished. I am so easily distracted by Mencken's cranky elitism.
