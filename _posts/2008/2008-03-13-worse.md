It's doubtful TORCHWOODÂ will ever stack up, for me, against something written by Aaron Sorkin or David Simon, but this season's writing is much worse than last. We get it! Cinema killed the travelling show! Find a new way to say it, Jack. 

Thank God for boys in nice suits with their sleeves rolled up.
