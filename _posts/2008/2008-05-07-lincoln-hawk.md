There's this podcast I love, YOU LOOK NICE TODAY. It makes me laugh until I hiccup. They made an observation recently that many lj posts start with a very earnest "You guys," and now I can't stop. I got to watch both BROTHERS & SISTERS and GOSSIP GIRLÂ in real time this week. But, today, I watched my favourite scenes again, three times, and, you guys, two coming outs in two days on two network television shows. My TV is so good to me. 

GOSSIP GIRL had me right up to those last 15 seconds. That was a moment worthy of an internet acronym. WTF.
