1. I went to Granville Island to see AS YOU LIKE IT. They did it in the 1950s. The Duke is banished by the FBI, the songs are spoken by Beatniks with bongos, and Orlando keeps humming, "why must I be a teenager in love?" 

2. And yet people still don't understand when I explain fan fiction as a way to explore the characters we love in different environments?

3. There's something wrong w/ your AS YOU LIKE IT, I think, if Touchstone isn't stealing the show. 

4. "Tonight, Tonight" is such a formative song for me. I must have it burned in my brain b/c today, on the train, was the first time I noticed in Panic's cover that Brendon sings, "the place where Jon was born." I might have laughed out loud? 

5. Zombies walking down Vancouver streets w/o satisfactory explanation and never when I had my camera out. 

6. Have I said this before? Or was it just on Twitter? I really want Panic to do the whole of Kate Bush's HOUNDS OF LOVE album. The first half is stacked w/ hits, then it descends into this epic concept-y thing about witches and clouds. Bands as other bands, dude.
