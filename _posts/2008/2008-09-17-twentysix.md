[Twentysix Gasoline Stations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twentysix_Gasoline_Stations)

I had that awesome moment of, Hey, that's my idea. Jeff Koons has his art fabricated in factories, and Valentino's dresses are sewn by women in Italy. Maya Lin didn't build the Vietman Veterans Memorial, and Twyla Tharp doesn't dance her dances. I have notebooks full of ideas, notes, references, sketches, outlines, snippets of conversation and kickass first lines. That's what satisfies me about making a story. I like this part of it so much more than the writing. Is there a factory somewhere that will fabricate my novels for me? I just want to design.
