Between the [Factory Records](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factory_Records#FAC_numbers) catalogue and the years I spent in an actual factory, stamping boxes with serial numbers, I want a brand where everything has a number. I've been going with Vanishing City, a pair of words by Fitzgerald. My 1986 secondhand copy of THE GREAT GATSBY can be VC001. This blog here is VC002. I'm not sure what VC003 will be, but I kinda like it that way.
