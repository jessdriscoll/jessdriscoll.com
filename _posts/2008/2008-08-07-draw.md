I always think that I can't draw. You know, boys like math, girls like booksâ€“that kind of thing. Just an assumption. It's true that I can't draw people. And, god, I just attempted a dinosaur who looks like he has an eating disorder. But I do an awesome stapler or TARDIS or plastic container that I brought my lunch in. My trees are only OK. It's the organics that give me trouble. I can draw my shoe until the cows come home, but I can't draw the cows.

I'll have to call it 'no-life drawing.'
