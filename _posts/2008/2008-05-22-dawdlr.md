Last November, I was wondering about my degree. Now, I'm almost done. I sent my postcard to Dawdlr about a month ago, when I had just returned to my daydream about moving to P.E.I. Now, I've been accepted to SFU here in Vancouver, and the Olympics are coming, and I still want to travel, but I'm not sure I want to move. You wouldn't think six months was long enough to make you wary about your whole life.
