SHELTER has gotten to me. The movie's about surfing and art and family--however you define it--and there's a kid, and it's kind of like every single storyÂ I've ever loved. 

And I'm still not over BREAKFAST WITH SCOT. Tom Cavanaugh is an ex-hockey player, turned sportscaster, still not comfortable out of the closet. Ben Shenkman was his ex-lawyer, now his boyfriend, and they take in the gayest 11-year-old in Canada. 

Totally not related, but it just came up on shuffle and, damn, "Coming out of the sun" by Joe Firstman is a gorgeously epic song.
