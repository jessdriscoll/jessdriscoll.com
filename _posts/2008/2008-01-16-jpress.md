[Wikipedia: J. Press#Cultural references](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Press) They're all so good. I can't quote just one.

>J. Press is mentioned in Whit Stillman's 1990 film METROPOLITAN.

>Former President George H.W. Bush has been a loyal J. Press client since his days at Yale College in the 1940s. During the 1980 election, after being described as a "Brooks Brothers Republican," Bush opened his jacket to reveal a J. Press logo.

>Sensitive about suggestions he dressed like a "hayseed," Bill Clinton went to J. Press's location in Cambridge before the 1992 campaign. To be sure he made no mistake, Clinton bought Press's "Pressidential" suits.

>A white button-down shirt from J. Press was a minor plot element in the American TV series SPORTS NIGHT.
