I've been calling this idea Three Views of a Murder, but I don't think that was meant to be the title. More like the slugline, because the conceit is one family, three generations, and a single unsolved murder. 

I'm not sure, but I think this was born before I watched a single episode of THE WIRE. A lifetime of watching procedurals, of course, but before THE WIRE married cops to the other institutions, in particular, the paper. I spent just as much time naming my newspapers as I did my characters. You have to know I meant to make this a multi-media venture. They all are.
