1. Um, I did it. In fact, I did 20k words of it. I enjoyed it so much, felt so productive and so accomplished, that I'm gonna do it for the next 11 months, too. Well, not every month. Megan'll be taking half of them.

2. This month, I'm hanging onto the momentum and focusing on a few of my older and tinier stories. I've been doing a ruthless clearing out of old text files, random pieces of story, but some are too good to give away. Some are very close to being done. So that's my December. 

3. I don't know about January yet.
