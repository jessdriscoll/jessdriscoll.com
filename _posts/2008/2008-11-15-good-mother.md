[Jay Brannan @ Super Market [good mother]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcbql-TQXQ8)

Here is a story about how the internet is awesome. I've got iTunes on random and Jann Arden's "Good Mother" comes up. It's a great song, but I'm sure the video is classic mid-'90s Can-con. So I hit up YouTube and find a whole page of live performances and covers instead. This video is the very last, and I don't know why I decided to watch it. 

There are too many bad homemade covers on YouTube, and I just don't click a lot of links without more information. But something about the colours in the stillâ€“my eye knew it was a good video. 

It is. I liked him, immediately, even before he started singing. I paused the video to check his website. He's on tour. He'll be in Vancouver in less than a week. I think I have to go see him play.
If he's not coming to your town, watch Jay Brannan on YouTube.
