This blog where I rate songs on my iPod goes a long time without an update (I completely missed the month of February 2007). Because I'm doing this thing in alphabetical order, I'll get to the next song, and there's just nothing to say, good or bad. This is why I'm doing it in the first place--to get rid of those songs. Also, I'm not always sure why I like or don't like a song. But, the rest of the time, I'm listening to songs for which I have crazy love and nowhere to yell it out, except for the bus, when I can't help but tap my feet and mouth the words. I don't know--I kinda want to start writing love letters to songs.

Dear "9 to 5" by Dolly Parton, 

You kick ass. Wanna go out? 

Love, me
