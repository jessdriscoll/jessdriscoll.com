I still know all the words to every song on Simon and Garfunkel's GREATEST HITS album. It must be like how I got my ears pierced when I was four months old and they'll never grow over, even after years of not wearing earrings. I still know what order those songs come in. I'm not, on principle, a greatest hits person. I much prefer the album, but if I ever heard "Cecilia" on BRIDGE OVER TROUBLED WATER, I'd expect the it to end right there.

But this was the only Simon and Garfunkel album my parents owned, the GREATEST HITS from 1972 (we had two copies, actually, which is a sign of two people with great taste in music combining their record collections). My parents have an amazing record collection, which has shaped me, not only as a music fan, but as a person. It was a few years ago now that I realised if I ever did have a book in me it would be about that record collection. For me, this album was Simon and Garfunkel.

The idea that hit me on the bus this week, listening to it again and knowing all the words, was starting a Simon and Garfunkel cover band. We'd call ourselves Simon and Garfunkel's Greatest Hits, and we'd sing the songs in order. We'd dress like they do on the cover. I'm blonde, my hair goes frizzy, so I'll be the Garfunkel. Now I need a Simon.
