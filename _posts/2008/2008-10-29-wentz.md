Somewhere, there is a world where the Jonas Brothers were discovered by Pete Wentz instead of Disney. 

When Pete finally starts making movies with all his friends, something like THE GREAT RACE, IT'S A MAD, MAD, MAD, MAD WORLD, or CANNONBALL RUN would be the perfect place to start.

Or this obscure Burt Reynolds movie:

>W.W. is a happy-go-lucky crook who makes his living robbing gas stations through the drive-up windows. The Dixie Dancekings are a country music band trying to get their first big break. W.W. crosses paths with the Dixie Dancekings when he hijacks their car (and them) to help him rob a bank. At first, the band resists. However, when they discover how much money they make, they begin helping out voluntarily in order to finance their big break. At the same time, W.W. takes a liking to them and uses his natural charm and smooth-talking ways to help them start down the road to stardom.
