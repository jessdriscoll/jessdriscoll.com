I have spent a large chunk of my lifetime watching GHOSTBUSTERS I and/or II in the dark, in the daytime, or in a makeshift movie theatre, projected onto a white bedsheet. These photos were taken in that makeshift movie theatre.

Even blurred from long exposure, at an unusual angle, or caught between frames, the source is recognisable. GHOSTBUSTERS is burned into some part of my brain that ensures I will know it always, even out of the corner of my eye. 

This set of photos is watching a movie again and seeing it different. For me, this project couldn't be anything but GHOSTBUSTERS, but it is also a movie that could not be better suited to the kind of otherworldly apparitions that lowlight photography produces. 

At first, I was only going to take the one photoâ€“an after to go with the before of the screen and the lights on. Except I kept clicking. I take most of my photos blind. I shoot and sort out the mess later. The ones that came out of this mess were not at all what I had in my head, but that's the surprise.

It doesn't actually become art until you get it out of your head.
