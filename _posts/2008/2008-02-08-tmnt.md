My brothers and I grew up in the 1980s with TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES. This semester, I'm doing a class of Italian Renaissance art history. The dates don't quite shake out, but there's a sitcom here. Donatello leaves his tools all over the house, and Leonardo, his flying machines. Michelangelo never warns them when he's having boys over, and Raphael is never there when it's his turn to do the dishes.
