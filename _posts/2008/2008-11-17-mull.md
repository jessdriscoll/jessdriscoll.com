1. I've been thoroughly disappointed by ATLANTIS this season, but that's OK, 'cause both CHUCK and GOSSIP GIRL have been fantastic. I love all Chucks! 

2. Um. I don't hate the new LJ profile. Are we past that yet? 

4. It feels like it's been forever since I wrote a post. I feel out of the habit. I've tried, recently, to use LJ for talking about creating, rather than talking about things. Not that I don't love reading my f(riends)list talking about things, I absolutely do. But I use Twitter and other blogs for that. Ideas are moving pretty fast from abstract to concrete these days, with little time to mull. LJ was where I mulled aloud. 

5. Adding to this weirdness is that by the end of this month, I will be really and truly done with my undergraduate years. I'm applying to grad school, but there's this part in the back of my brain hoping I don't get accepted. There's a part of me that just wants to get out of town, pick up, and try something new.
