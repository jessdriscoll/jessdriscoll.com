I discovered tonight that Sylvester Stallone's name in OVER THE TOP, his arm-wrestling movie, is Lincoln Hawk. OVER THE TOP, you might remember, is one of Sandy Cohen's favourite movies. I was going to make a post, talking about the latest episode of GOSSIP GIRL, but mostly complaining that Lincoln Hawk doesn't have website where I can download their songs, but this weird bit of Josh Schwartz trivia totally made my night.
