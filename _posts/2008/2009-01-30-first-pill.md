>The second pill cost 'em four cents; the first pill cost 'em four hundred million dollars. 

Josh, THE WEST WING: In This White House

The second pill costs four cents because we've figured it out and now it's easy. Except, instead of looking ahead to how easy it'll be to publish once I get the prototype and the process down, I have this feeling of being tied to the first edition, but, god, magazines redesign themselves all the time. This is really just me telling myself I can do this even if I don't have a logo. This is a really annoying kind of perfectionism. I couldn't have the one that gets you straight As?
