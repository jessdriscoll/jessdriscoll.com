Things that strike me in the shower: the dad in PUMP UP THE VOLUME is the same guy who played the pot-smoking doctor in CSI: "Gum Drops." The weirdest thing about this is that I haven't seen either this movie or this episode in ages. I wasn't thinking about Christian Slater or George Eads. I wasn't anywhere near the thought when I happened upon it. But I love when that happens.
