Something called Studiolo? A workshop with an architect, a painter, a sculptor, a writer, and throw in a couple of apprentices. Their patron is always dropping by to check on his commissions and to complain about how much great art costs these days. Some sweeps highlights include: the first full-size bronze nude since Roman times, the first time someone paints on canvas, a group project cathedral, and the inevitable overthrow of the patron's powerful family. I've always been easily intrigued by new things, but I never would have guessed the Italian Renaissance would be next. I still love you American Modernism, I swear!
