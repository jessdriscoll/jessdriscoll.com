1. Here are a few scenes from the life of Sophie Rose Cohen that I'm sad we'll never get to see: spending the weekend with Ryan and Taylor at their house (where they have dogs!), learning how to surf the waves and schmear a bagel, holding her newborn niece or nephew who will probably end up with the name Cr√®pe Cohen. 

2. I think, also, that Ryan is the first to show her Paris, on a trip to visit Taylor, teaching at the Sorbonne. 

2. I watched MR. AND MRS. SMITH this weekend, and I'm pretty sure that Benjamin "The Tank" Danz is actually Seth Cohen who only gets to be a hitman because Ryan was recruited first and, well, it's not really his fault that Seth doesn't take, "I'm busy," for an answer, and shows up with bagels at Ryan's first hit.
