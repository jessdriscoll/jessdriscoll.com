My neighbourhood is named for Elias J. Newton. But he was born Villeneuve, which also means "new town," a name that Elias thought sounded too French, out here among the anglophones in the West. I'm rather glad he changed it as I'm terribly fond of Newton and hope to use it in a name one day when I put out my shingle. Or, maybe, Elias J.
