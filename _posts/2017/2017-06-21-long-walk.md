After listening to [an interview with Adriel Wallick](https://www.relay.fm/ltoe/5), who made a game a week, I fell in love with the itch.io platform. Not only is a place for people to post their work, but it's a community of ideas. Game jams have a deadline and a theme--two things that have always worked well for me in the past when I want to make a thing. 

[Long walk at sunrise](https://jessdriscoll.itch.io/long-walk-at-sunrise) is my entry for the emoji game jam.

This is the story of a snail 🐌 and an octopus 🐙 who wrote letters and fell in love. Now they want to meet in person. Sunrise is the best time to avoid the chaos of the beach. Help them meet on the shore 🌅.
