1. Even if I'm not posting here, I'm always writing. That's why I take a notebook with me wherever I go. I even take it with me when I move from room to room in my house. (Except the bathroom.) (Usually.)

2. This week, it would be more truthful to write about what's not working for me. But that would be a very long list, and I've committed to picking four things. I'm really liking the number four lately. It's a nice structure for a lot of things.

3. I bought pre-ground coffee recently. It was on sale, plus there was a coupon, and it's kinda local. (Portland, Oregon.) I don't have a coffee grinder, so what I usually do is grind the beans by hand in my mortar and pestle. It's not my most favourite thing to do in the mornings, but I've turned it into a kind of meditation. Still, not having to do it this week has been nice.

4. I forgot my prescription sunglasses at my parents's house last week. So this week I have been wearing my non-prescription huge pink plastic sunglasses. (<a href="http://jessdriscoll.com/selfie.html">These ones</a>.) They don't fit as well over my new regular glasses, so I've been wearing them without, which means I can't see further than six inches in front of my face. As much as I believe it's important to look around when you're walking, the world can be a lot. You don't have to let it all in.
