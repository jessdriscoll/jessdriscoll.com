It's been 11 months since Brexit and 6 months since the US election. The world is in a bad place right now, and Canada is caught--literally--in the middle. We are England's daughter and America's sister. We are a member of the Commonwealth and a major trade partner. But beyond that, the UK and the US are such large international powers that what happens to them affects the entire world.

I can feel it affecting me.

I published my first novella in 2013. For the next two years, I tried really hard to write full time, but I couldn't write fast enough to make enough money. So I found a day job and gave up fiction for while. But in 2017, happy endings feel more important than ever. We all need a few more happy endings in our lives right now.
