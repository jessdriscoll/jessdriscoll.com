Wildflowers, words by Emily Carr, illustrations by Emily Henrietta Woods

“Today has been wonderful, winter and spring shaking hands.” in a letter to a friend, February, 1941

“Every exalted garden aristocrat has its beginning in a wild flower and if that garden flower is left to its own devices it will sneak back to wildness.” (11)

“A subtle perfume compounded of the scent of live grasses, mosses, earth, heat, dark, silence, wind, and sunshine: so perfectly combined as to be completely satisfying.” (73)
