Tonight is a new moon, and I'm thinking about new projects. Three days left in February, and more than 20 pages to fill in my notebook, but this is what I do. I fill a notebook every month. It's nice to have the weekend off from yoga. I wrote my three morning pages, then I walked down to the beach and wrote some more while I ate lunch and watched the ocean. I took the bus all the way up the hill into town to get coffee. Anybody interested in the Starbucks Writing Club?

It was sunny in the morning (but cold). It was raining as I walked home. As soon as I walked through the door, the hail started. Then the sun came out again. Life goes like that, and my best days are the ones when I remember.
