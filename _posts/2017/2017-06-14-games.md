> If one looked solely at videogames, one would think the whole of human experience is shooting men and taking their dinner orders.  

<a href="http://www.indiebound.org/book/9781609803728">Anna Anthropy, Rise of the Videogame Zinesters</a>

Anthropy critiques something important in this passage, but I laughed reading this because I really love those video games where you take dinner orders, make the food, serve the food, then collect the money. My favourite is <a href="http://deliciousemily.com">the Delicious series.</a> These games are part of the time management genre. They're also called "casual" games because they're not about shooting men.

I love games. I grew up through the rise of video games. Though my mom forbid my grandpa from buying us an original Nintendo, we had an Atari 2600. We had games on floppy disks. We bought used GameBoys one year with our Christmas money. I have played years of Microsoft Solitaire.

But there are a lot of men who wouldn't call me a gamer. It doesn't matter that I do crosswords, love Scrabble, play Trivial Pursuit. In their eyes, those don't count as games. I wrote and designed a game with my dad as a family Christmas present last year. It's a card collecting game called Ingredients. The object is to combine foods into dishes and create a full six-course meal.

Another "casual" game about dinner.

As I was reading Anna Anthropy's book today, I started a list in my notebook. It's now three two-column pages long. It's a list of games I loved to play, I used to play, I still play. I texted my brother to help me remember the name of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Force">the police game we played on PC</a>. I found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIuxB1oR2WQ">SIX HOURS of Lemmings on YouTube</a>.

I've been thinking a lot about books lately. I will forever be a writer, but my ideal format isn't a book; it's a blog post. Besides, what is the internet but a giant text adventure game.
