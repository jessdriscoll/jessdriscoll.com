I just spent $150 for a ticket to see Harry Styles at Rogers Arena next July. That's July 2018, more than a year away. Back when he first announced his solo album, I said, "Harry better not make me pay another $100+ to see him or we're gonna be in a fight."

So we're in a fight now.

One Direction played BC Place in 2015. We didn't know then that it would be their last tour before the hiatus, and I spent a long time thinking about whether I wanted to go. I ended up finding floor seats for $100 in the last few weeks before the show, Elisabeth decided to fly out to come with me, and I'm so glad we went.

But BC Place is where our football and soccer teams play, and Rogers Arena is where our hockey team plays. I love Harry Styles because he's a weirdo aesthete, and I was really hoping I could see his solo tour in one of our interwar music halls, instead of a hollow arena.

Still, I love his music, his sparkly boots, and his commitment to trying something new, so that's where I'll be July 2018. Five years of being fascinated by Harry Styles, and he hasn't disappointed me yet.
