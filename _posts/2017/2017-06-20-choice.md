The last Emily Carr book at my library is <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Unsettling-Encounters-First-Nations-Imagery/dp/0774812826/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1498025143&amp;sr=1-2&amp;keywords=Gerta+moray">Unsettling Encounters by Gerta Moray.</a> It's 400 pages long. It's a hardcover, 22.6 x 30.9 cm, and 1.8 Kg (according to Amazon). It basically lives on my bedside table, and I read a chapter a night. This is the second time I've borrowed it, and I'm gonna have to renew it again to finish reading it.

In the same time, I've read a half dozen books on my iPad.

I love books. I love paper. But I also love choice.
