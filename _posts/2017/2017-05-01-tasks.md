I'm done The Artist's Way, so I'm writing my own tasks. I don't want to lose the momentum. Every day, I write three pages in my notebook. On Fridays, I write Four Things That Are Working For Me This Week. Every fortnight, I send a newsletter about all the blog posts you missed (and a little bit extra).

And now I'm making [a video](http://youtube.com/watch?v=324SlB6scZc) most days. This is day one. It also happens to be the first day of a new month. All I have to do is keep checking off the days.
