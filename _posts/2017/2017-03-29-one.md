Instead of reading the blogs of fellow writers, I read a lot of blogs by software developers. I suppose it has something to do with wanting in your free time the exact opposite of what you do in your work time. My brother is a chef and butcher, and the last thing he wants to do at holidays is cook. My work is all about books, and the last thing I want to do is read book reviews. I have too many unread books on my shelves to even think about buying more.

But I find a lot to learn from software developers, especially those who run their own businesses, usually one person shops. I run a one person shop, too. We both sell digital products. You spend a lot of unpaid time making a thing, but when it’s done, you have a product you can sell without extra labour. You don’t have to build app or ebook again; you only have to copy and paste.

Keep building your catalogue, and keep building your audience. Eventually, the one will find the other.
