In TREASURE ISLAND, Jim Hawkins finds a map, sealed in oilcloth, in a dead man's sea chest.

>Tall tree, Spy-glass shoulder, bearing a point to the N. of N.N.E.  
Skeleton Island E.S.E. and by E.  
Ten feet.  
The bar silver is in the north cache; you can find it by the trend of the east hummock, ten fathoms south of the black crag with the face on it.  
The arms are easy found, in the sand-hill, N. point of north inlet cape, bearing E. and a quarter N.  
J.F. 

[MAP OF AN ISLAND](https://jessdriscoll.itch.io/map-of-an-island) is a drawing game. The object is to recreate a map from limited information. (Perhaps it will help you find Captain Flint's treasure.)
