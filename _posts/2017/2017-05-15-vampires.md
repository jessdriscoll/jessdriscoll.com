I literally (and I use that word correctly) said <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOfVgOm-78c">this morning</a> that I was giving up on the vampire story. I've been trying to write something short for an anthology submission, and the deadline is today. I thought I would write this weekend; I didn't. This morning, I finally said, meh. Vampires just aren't my thing. I shouldn't feel bad about not writing this story.

But I did feel bad! I felt like I failed. I felt a lot like at the beginning of the month when I did this exact same thing. I didn't dictate this time around. I just sat on my couch with my laptop and wrote directly into Scrivener. Because there is more than one way to write a story. You have to keep moving to find the way that's going to work at that moment. Today, it was getting annoyed enough with myself that I wrote the thing out of spite.

I am not complaining. This is story #3 in 30 days, since I decided to try writing fiction again. The next deadline is at the end of the month. I hope to come back and tell you that I didn't second guess myself again, but I think we all know how this is going to end. But at least I'll get story #4 out of the struggle.
