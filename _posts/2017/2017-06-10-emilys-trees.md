The Emily Carr floor at VAG right now is her forest paintings. I'm in love. They have Grey and Scorned and Sea Drift and Little Pine. I wish they had Sunshine. Some I've never seen before. Her very first BC forests after coming home from France. A weird unfinished looking thing that is legit like no other Carr I've seen. An evolutionary exhibit. Following her from the '10s to her last in the '40s. How she saw our trees has changed how we see our trees. No one can say otherwise. Even if you're not sure who she is, if you live in Canada, you have seen Emily's trees. You have seen BC's trees.
