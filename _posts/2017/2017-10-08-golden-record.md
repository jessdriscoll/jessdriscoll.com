Voyager 1 left Earth in 1977, and today, it flies farther than anything else we have sent into space. We may not live to meet the beings beyond our solar system, but Voyager carries our message: 116 pictures, 90 minutes of music, the sounds of Earth, and greetings in 55 languages, carved into the grooves of a golden record.

Today, 40 years later, technology has changed, and we can send much more. You have been tasked with choosing the greetings from Earth in 2017. This game will help you make a new [golden record](https://jessdriscoll.itch.io/golden-record).
