I took an accidental vacation from everything over spring break. Even though I took three Emily Carr books with me to my parents's house, I didn't read any of them. Granted, one of those books is a hardback catalogue sized beast called [Unsettling Encounters by Gerta Moray](http://www.ubcpress.ca/search/title_book.asp?BookID=1960). It's the critique of Carr's cultural appropriation I've been wanting to read, but it's definitely a couch book. I'm almost wishing for an epub.

As I continue importing old blog posts over here, I've been finding a lot of songs on YouTube to replace dead links. Out of curiosity, I searched Emily Carr, wanting to see [the classic Heritage Minute](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEbpE3YLlfE), but also whatever else popped up. This [15 minute NFB film](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JrWjhWY5jY), directed by Graham McInnes, is what I found. Directed in 1946, the year after Carr died, it shares many of her attitudes. It presents the aboriginal people of BC as a "dying" culture.

And then there's this, the closing paragraph:

"The canvases of Emily Carr are themselves an inspiration. They show that if an artist feels overwhelmingly the urge to paint, it matters little that he works alone, for from the images of his land, he can create paintings that will always arouse deep emotions in the hearts of his fellow men."

Like, are you fucking kidding me? It matters a lot that SHE works alone, because women didn't do that in Emily Carr's lifetime. It matters a lot that HER paintings aroused feelings in the hearts of HER fellow WOMEN. When we're talking about Emily Carr, who did everything she could to remain independent, it matters a lot that you give her that credit. She's the most famous artist from BC, and she is a woman. Don't take that away from us.
