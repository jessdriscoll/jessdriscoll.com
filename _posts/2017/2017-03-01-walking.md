I walk a lot. I started my current job two years ago and moved three months later, deliberately, because I wanted to be within walking distance. It's 25 minutes up the hill. It's 7 minutes down to the beach. It's just over an hour across town. I like to wander.

But I'm also learning how to drive. That'll be the next big goal. It's been six months since I failed the test a second time and let my learner's license expire. I'm not afraid to get back in the car. I'm just tired of practice. I want to be onto the next thing already.

For now, walking is easier. I may not be able to go as far as I want, but I don't have to rely on anyone to get there.
