Pretty sure I'm officially a vlogger. Four videos today:

1. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA6MhcMfSqQ">May 06</a>
2. and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHbYRSGLH9c">May 07 </a> are both, inexplicably over 16 minutes long, and I had to wait to upload them at home because the wifi where I was staying this weekend couldn't handle them. That gave me a chance to drop in a bit of video of Saturday's hail storm.
3. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFlhfaFKK6s">May 08</a> is today's video, one week after I started.
4. In between waiting for videos to upload, I pieced together a few tiny clips I made on Saturday's hike into <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0WyquLPz_w">Follow the Arrow</a>. I spotted the first arrow on a telephone pole beside my bus stop. And then I just kept finding them along the trail. It's filmed with the front-facing camera, in bright sun, so it's not perfect, but that's the point of this project. I've been shooting tiny pieces of video since I got my first digital camera in the mid-2000s. It's time to actually do something with them all. It doesn't have to be perfect; it just has to be done.
