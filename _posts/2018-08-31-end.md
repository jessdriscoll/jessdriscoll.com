WHAT I LEARNED IN AUGUST
by someone, who made and posted something every day.

1. I am a conceptual artist.
2. I still know how to do this.
3. But I can't do it every day forever.
4. Maybe don't pick a 31 day month next time.
5. Deadlines are necessary.
6. Public accountability works.
7. Just enough is good enough.
8. Procrastination expands to fill the allotted time.
9. PDFs are what I wish I could do with webpages.
10. Pulling all nighters is for kids.
11. I like making on iOS, regardless of the size of the screen.
12. I do good work lying in bed in the dark.
13. I want to keep going.
14. But I know I need a break.
15. I miss paper.
16. I will never run out of ideas.
17. Rules are what you make them.
18. Stats don't matter.
19. Neither does money.
20. Though a little more of both would be nice.
