HOW TO FOLD THE WORLD INTO A BOOK

<p>In a zine class for children, the focus is experimentation. A single piece of paper, folded and stapled, will be turned into a fantastical book with their stories and drawings, incorporating multi-media such as collage and stamps. 

<p>In a zine class for teenagers, the focus is publishing. Zines offer an alternative to social media, as well as an opportunity to build community and collective action. Participants will draw inspiration from my personal library and learn about the history of zine-making. Both paper and digital techniques will be taught.

<p>In a zine class for adults, the focus is expression. Zines are a low-pressure entry to making art. But once you have made youâ€™re first, you discover there are dozens more ideas you want to bring to life. More complicated techniques such as sewn bindings and envelope folding will be taught.

<p>At the Semiahmoo Library, I host a regular zine workshop. Our next series happens on Sunday afternoons in October, 2019. These informal sessions proved a success, particularly amongst children under 10. They love the space to experiment and the opportunity to play with art supplies. 

<p>Though I graduated with a Bachelor of Arts from Kwantlen University, my teaching experience stretches back to high school, when I began tutoring elementary students in French. I currently work in a private after school program for students ranging in ages 4-18. Each day brings something new, which is perfect because my teaching superpower is improvisation.
