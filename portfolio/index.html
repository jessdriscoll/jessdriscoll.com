           <p>In 2011, the Vancouver Canucks made the Stanley Cup final for only the third time in their 40-year-old history. Also in 2011, I left the west coast for the first time, to see the other side of my country, to live in Halifax, to try something new. I watched Game 7 in a hostel with a group of Irish and Australian tourists. Instead of watching the disastrous third period, I put my head down and wrote this essay.

           <p>If you wear women's clothing, you probably know the problem. Finding a garment with wonderfully deep, open, useful pockets (or any pockets at all!) is like finding gold at the end of the rainbow. But until we overthrow the patriarchy, here are two ways--easy and hard--to add pockets to your clothes.
        <p><img src="/img/theband.jpg" alt="THE BAND">
           <p>The Band didn't have a leader. They didn't even have a lead singer. They had three voices who could carry a band all by themselves, and everyone took a turn at the mic. Five guys, and everyone took a turn being the one who made The Band The Band. Robbie made the songs, and Garth made the sound. Richard had a contradiction of a voice, and Levon had the vision. Rick made the harmonies that held it all together.
        <p><img src="/img/solitaires.jpg" alt="SOLITAIRES">
           <p>I grew up calling that game “solitaire,” though it’s actually a variant called “Klondike.” And then, about a year ago, I learned that “solitaire” is a variant name, too. In England, the game is called “patience.” My British granny was a knitter, not a card player, so I didn’t learn this name until I read it in a book. I like this name. It tells a different story about why I love the game.
        <p><img src="/img/moon.jpg" alt="MOON">
           <p>The first person to stand on the moon was an astronaut named Neil Armstrong. / The craters on the moon make people think they can see a face. But there is no man on the moon.
