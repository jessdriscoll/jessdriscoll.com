           <p>In 2011, the Vancouver Canucks made the Stanley Cup final for only the third time in their 40-year-old history. Also in 2011, I left the west coast for the first time, to see the other side of my country, to live in Halifax, to try something new. I watched Game 7 in a hostel with a group of Irish and Australian tourists. Instead of watching the disastrous third period, I put my head down and wrote this essay.
