	<p>We're making a zine about how much we love <a href="https://2019.xoxofest.com">XOXO</a>! 
	<p>Everyone is welcome to contribute, even if you don't call yourself an artist or writer. If you can fill a 14 cm Ã— 21 cm / 5.5 by 8.25 inch piece of paper, you can contribute.
	<p>The (soft) deadline is AUGUST 15th. Please email your page to me: jessvdriscoll at gmail. Almost any digital format is fine, but some suggestions: pdf, doc, odt, png, gif, txt. Please note how you would like to be credited and include links where readers can find you. 
  <p>Once the pages are assembled, I'll send you a print-ready pdf. You are then free to print it however you like. Distribute to your friends you won't be in PDX and make them jealous. Bring copies to the fest to share with other attendees. Leave them around the city for folks to read.
