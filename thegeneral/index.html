title: we should open a bakery.

<div class="blurb">
	<p>We didn't set out to start the Review. We set out to start a bakery. The General was founded in 2009 with an exchange which went something like this:
<p>Jess: We should open a bakery.
<br>Megan: We should totally open a bakery! 
<p>Opening a bakery, turns out, is really fucking hard to do. We started <a href="https://www.alldaybreakfast.org/product/the-general-review-volume-1/22?cp=true&sa=false&sbp=false&q=false&category_id=5">The General Review</a> instead: a zine of food, ideas, and stories. It's the best of what comes out of a kitchen full of friends. We share a far-reaching curiosity, which inspired the name: General. Each issue of the Review is hyper-focused on one food-related noun, explored through memories, recipes, drawings, and lists.
