<p>You can call me Jess or Jessica; my pronouns are she/her and singular they. I'm a teacher, mostly reading and writing, mostly elementary school kids. This website is the the most recent iteration of a blog I started on Blogspot in 2002. These days, I write and publish more zines than blog posts, and during the summer farmers market season, I bake and sell sourdough bread. I live and work on the unceded territory of the Semiahmoo Nation. With gratitude and a commitment to unsettling Turtle Island, I redistribute 10% of my income to <a href="http://www.tinyhousewarriors.com/">support Indigenous land defenders</a>. This is the land where I was born and raised, where I've hiked and camped, and to where I've always returned.
