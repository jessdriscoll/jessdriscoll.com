<p>You can call me Jess or Jessica; my pronouns are she/they. I teach kids how to read and write, and I write zines and bake sourdough bread for the farmers market. I live and work on the unceded territory of the SEMYOME Nation. My commitment to unsettling Turtle Island includes redistributing 10% of my income to <a href="http://www.tinyhousewarriors.com/">support Indigenous land defenders</a>.
