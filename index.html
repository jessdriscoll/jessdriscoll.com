<p>You probably found this website because you read something I wrote or ate something I baked. I go by Jess online and Jessica IRL; my pronouns are she/her and singular they. I'm a writer, a teacher, a baker--depending on the season. I live and work on the unceded territory of the SEMYOME (Semiahmoo) Nation, in a beach town on the International Boundary. As a white settler, my commitment to unsettling Turtle Island includes redistributing 10% of my monthly income to <a href="http://www.tinyhousewarriors.com">support Indigenous land defenders</a>.
