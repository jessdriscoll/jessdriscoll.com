	<p>The 1996 Romeo + Juliet is the reason I got online. I was a Generation X teenager, born on the last day of 1981, and now I'm a Millennial adult who's never made more than $20k a year. I go by Jess online and Jessica IRL; my pronouns are she/her and singular they. As a white settler Canadian, I acknowledge the Semiahmoo First Nation and their unceded land where I live, and I'm committed to decolonisation and abolition. 
	<p>You probably found this website because you read something I wrote and ate something I baked. My tiny book and bakeshop is called <a href="https://www.instagram.com/alldaybreakfastdotorg/">All Day Breakfast</a>. Find me on the first two Sundays of each month at the <a href="http://www.whiterockfarmersmarket.ca">White Rock Farmers Market</a>, but if you're not a local, you can <a href="http://alldaybreakfast.org">shop provisions online</a>. If it was my zines that brought you here, why don't you subscribe to my weekly letter below?
