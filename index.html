	<p>I write tiny stories and make tiny books. My books are available <a href="https://www.etsy.com/ca/shop/jessdriscoll">in print on Etsy</a> and <a href="https://jessdriscoll.itch.io">as digital downloads on Itch.io</a>.  
	<p>My work lives in the space between analogue and digital. This website is only the most recent version of a blog I started on blogspot.com in 2002. I teach <a href="/workshops">workshops</a> for kids and curious adults.
	<p>I’m a settler Canadian who lives on the unceded land of the Semiahmoo First Nation, neither British Columbia nor Washington. I was born on the last day of 1981, both Generation X and Millennial. My pronouns are she/her. You can call me Jess or Jessica.
