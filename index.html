	<p>Hi, I'm Jess. I live and teach on the unceded land of the Semiahmoo First Nation, a city called White Rock outside Vancouver, BC. It rains a lot here, but we also have the ocean, the trees, and the mountains that make life better. Since I saw Baz Luhrmann's ROMEO + JULIET in 1996 (the first film with a great website), I've been doing stuff on the internet. Mostly, that's writing. Sometimes, I take my best blog posts and turn them into paper zines. You can buy them on Etsy.</p>
