	<p>I'm a teacher who makes zines and a settler Canadian who lives on the unceded land of the Semiahmoo First Nation, neither British Columbia nor Washington. I was born in 1981, both Generation X and Millennial. This website is only the most recent version of a blog I started on blogspot.com in 2002.
	<p>My work comes from the spaces between analogue and digital. I host the Pen & Paper Club at my local library and teach zine-making workshops for kids and curious adults. <a href="mailto:factsarenothing@gmail.com">Contact me</a> to request a workshop for your group.
