	<p>I was a Generation X teenager, born on the last day of 1981, and now I'm a Millennial adult. I go by Jess online and Jessica IRL. My pronouns are she/her and singular they. My email address is jessvdriscoll (at) gmail (dot) com. <a href="https://cat-face.square.site">I sell tiny happy things.</a>
	<p>As a settler Canadian, I acknowledge the Semiahmoo First Nation and their unceded land where I live. The white rock which gave my city its name was coloured by bat guano. Now they repaint it every season because the bats are gone.
