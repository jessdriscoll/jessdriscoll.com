	<p>My work comes from the spaces between analogue and digital. This website is only the most recent version of a blog I started on blogspot.com in 2002. I host the Pen & Paper Club at my local library and teach zine-making workshops for kids and curious adults. <a href="mailto:factsarenothing@gmail.com">Contact me</a> to request a workshop for your group.  
	<p>Iâ€™m a settler Canadian who lives on the unceded land of the Semiahmoo First Nation, neither British Columbia nor Washington. I was born on the last day of 1981, both Generation X and Millennial. My pronouns are she/her. You can call me Jess or Jessica.
