	<p>Jess Driscoll lives and teaches on the unceded land of the Semiahmoo First Nation, a city called White Rock outside Vancouver, BC. Since she saw Baz Luhrmann's ROMEO + JULIET in 1996 (the first film with a great website), she has been doing stuff on the internet. Sometimes, she takes the best blog posts and turns them into paper zines. Some day, she would like to run a tiny shop.
