	<p>Hi, I'm Jess. I live and teach on the unceded land of the Semiahmoo First Nation, a city called White Rock outside Vancouver, BC. It rains a lot here, but we also have the ocean, the trees, and the mountains that make life better. Since I saw Baz Luhrmann's ROMEO + JULIET in 1996 (the first film with a great website), I've been doing stuff on the internet. Since 2002, that's been writing fan fiction and blogging. Sometimes, I take my best blog posts and turn them into paper zines. <a href="https://www.etsy.com/ca/shop/jessdriscoll">You can buy them on Etsy.</a> I'm not on Twitter anymore, but you can always find me here, at my name dot com.</p>
