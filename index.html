	<p>I was a Generation X teenager, born on the last day of 1981, and now I'm a Millennial adult. I go by Jess online and Jessica IRL. My pronouns are she/her and singular they. This website is the most recent version of the blog I started on Blogger in 2002. I write tiny stories and draw tiny books. Sign up below for a letter from me.
	<p>As a settler Canadian, I acknowledge the Semiahmoo First Nation and their unceded land where I live. The white rock which gave my city its name was made white with bat guano. Now they repaint it every month because the bats are gone.
