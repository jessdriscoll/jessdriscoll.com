	<p>I go by Jess on the internet, but still introduce myself as Jessica. I live on the unceded land of the Semiahmoo First Nation outside Vancouver, BC. I’ve been doing stuff on the internet since I was 19; now I’m 37. My blogs have previously lived at Blogspot, Livejournal, Wordpress, Twitter, Tumblr, 750words. Sometimes, I take my best blog posts and print them on paper. One day, I would like to run a tiny shop.</div><!-- /.blurb -->
