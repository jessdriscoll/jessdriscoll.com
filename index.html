	<p>I write tiny stories and make tiny books.
	<p>My work lives in the space between analogue and digital. This website is only the most recent version of a blog I started on blogspot.com in 2002. I teach story and zine workshops for kids and curious adults. <a href="mailto:factsarenothing@gmail.com">Learn how to make the most with a single piece of paper.</a>
	<p>I’m a settler Canadian who lives on the unceded land of the Semiahmoo First Nation, neither British Columbia nor Washington. I was born on the last day of 1981, both Generation X and Millennial. My pronouns are she/her. You can call me Jess or Jessica.
