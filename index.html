<p>You can call me Jess or Jessica; my pronouns are she/her and singular they. My home is the unceded territory of the Semiahmoo Nation. With gratitude and a commitment to unsettling Turtle Island, I redistribute 10% of my income to <a href="http://www.tinyhousewarriors.com/">support Indigenous land defenders</a>. <p>I make my living as a teacher, and for more than 20 years, I've taught toddlers how to bake, children how to read, teenagers how to write, adults how to speak English, seniors how to do yoga, and anyone who will listen how to make zines. In 2020, with a lifelong interest in analogue tools and the domestic arts, I created <a href="https://www.alldaybreakfast.org">All Day Breakfast</a>, a general store to sell the products of my experiments. <a href="https://www.alldaybreakfast.org">All Day Breakfast can be found online</a>, and when the sun comes out, at farmers markets and zinefests around the Pacific Northwest. <p>Since 2002, I've written a trail of blogs across the internet, the first on Blogspot. While I have <a href="http://jessdriscoll.com/zines/">a ten year back catalogue of published zines</a> (and a few fiction novellas if you know where to look), my first published book of nonfiction will be out in 2022 from <a href="https://microcosmpublishing.com">Microcosm Publishing</a>.
