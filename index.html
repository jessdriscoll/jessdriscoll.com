	<p>I was a Generation X teenager, born on the last day of 1981, and now I'm a Millennial adult. I go by Jess online and Jessica IRL. My pronouns are she/her and singular they. As a settler Canadian, I acknowledge the Semiahmoo First Nation and their unceded land where I live.
	<p>I love breakfast so much, I named my business <a href="http://alldaybreakfast.org">ALL DAY BREAKFAST</a>. Find me most Sundays at the <a href="http://www.whiterockfarmersmarket.ca">White Rock Farmers Market</a>, around the corner on Johnston and Russell, and <a href="http://alldaybreakfast.org">shop provisions online</a>.
