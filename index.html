	<p>The 1996 Romeo + Juliet is the reason I got online. I was a Generation X teenager, born on the last day of 1981, and now I'm a Millennial adult. I go by Jess online and Jessica IRL. My pronouns are she/her and singular they. As a settler Canadian, I acknowledge the Semiahmoo First Nation and their unceded land where I live.

	<p>I write stories, I teach kids, and I bake bread. You can visit my tiny shop, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/alldaybreakfastdotorg/">ALL DAY BREAKFAST</a>, on the first two Sundays of each month at the <a href="http://www.whiterockfarmersmarket.ca">White Rock Farmers Market</a> and <a href="http://alldaybreakfast.org">shop provisions online</a>.
