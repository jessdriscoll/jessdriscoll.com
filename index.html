	<p>Jess Driscoll lives and teaches on the unceded land of the Semiahmoo First Nation, a city called White Rock outside Vancouver, BC. Since she saw Baz Luhrmann's ROMEO + JULIET in 1996 (the first film with a great website), she has been doing stuff on the internet. Sometimes, she takes the best blog posts and prints them on paper. Some day, she would like to run a tiny shop. Until then, you can read her zines <a href=“https://www.etsy.com/ca/shop/jessdriscoll”>at Etsy</a>, play her games <a href=“https://jessdriscoll.itch.io/“>at itch.io</a>, and find lots more in the archives.
