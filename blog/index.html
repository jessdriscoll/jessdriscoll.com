<p>This blog started in 2002 on Blogspot. Since then, these words have lived at Livejournal, Twitter, Tumblr, 750words, Wordpress, and in plain text files on my laptop. Today, this blog is written in Markdown and Jekyll and hosted on GitHub Pages. <a href=“http://jessdriscoll.com/blog/atom.xml”>You can add the feed to your RSS reader.</a>
