If you search online for “zines pdf,” you’ll find the [Small Science Collective](http://www.smallsciencecollective.org). This disparate group has created a number of mini-zines, all available for free download, all on science-related topics. Some of certainly more educational than fun, but some are plain weird and delightful.

The mini-zine format is the perfect size for a single topic. One of my faves is just eyes. One of the best titles is “For the Birds.” The 8 pages of a single piece of paper are small enough to force a creator to be succinct. Use only necessary words.

The obvious audience for the Small Science zines is educators, but it’s also a great resource for people curious about what you can do with a zine. 

The answer is anything you want.
